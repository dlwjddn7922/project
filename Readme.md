|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5	|1/22/2022	All I |can say is they have very good ice cream I would for sure recommend their cookies and creme ice cream it is very good|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|4|	6/26/2022|	Nice little local place for ice cream.My favorite is their pumpkin shake ( Fall season special).( My Sweetness tolerance is low) Their LARGE SIZE ice cream usually seems too sweet after having ice cream for a while. But love their pina colada. So refreshing. Their Banana Split is good too.|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	8/7/2021	|A delicious treat on a hot day! Staff was very friendly and helpful-- gave us a sample and let us order a little earlier than open.|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|4|	7/28/2016|	"This was great service and a fun crew! I got the banana cream pie with chocolate ice cream. I loved the flavor of this. It had freshly cut bananas, graham crackers and chocolate ice cream. YUM!! The only thing that I noticed is that it melted pretty fast and it's a bit icy. I like creamier ice cream (so it had a bit more overrun that I prefer), but overall, was delicious!"|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	6/23/2015|	"This is one of my favorite places to get ice cream in the CU area. It's a bit of drive, but it is worth it. It's about 10 minutes from the far side of Urbana. Getting there is really easy. The atmosphere of the Dairy Barn is very kid friendly. There are many tables set up so that you can sit and enjoy the ice cream. When my friends and I went, the line was about a 20 minute wait, but it didn't seem like any time at all. An older gentlemen, I presume the manager or owner, was giving out samples to the entire line. You could tell that he took pride in the product he made and was excited to share it with everyone. The special that night was cappuccino ice cream. I added in cookie dough to make a ""tornado"" which is a blizzard like ice cream treat. It was so quite refreshing and was a nice treat on a humid night. The Dairy barn is a must go!"|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	5/1/2019	|"I've been coming to this ice cream stand since I was a little girl back in the 1970's. (Yes, it's been here for that long! Just not under the same ownership.) But not much has changed in those years in regards to their basic ice cream. It is a great family place! They are always accommodating when we want to tweak the menu item a bit :-) I love the rotating, special flavor of the week! Keep an eye on the Facebook page for that. It's always a joy to see the near constant long line. Shows how successful a small town business can be. If you are truly passionate about supporting small business, stay away from those franchises that make their ice cream at some corporate factory and come get some made fresh soft serve from your truly local business!!"|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|1|	8/11/2016	|"The soft-serve is way too sweet and has a strange Splenda-like aftertaste. The flavors tasted very artificial, and I ended up with a stomach ache when I got home... I really don't recommend this place, your simple Baskin Robbins is much better."|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	11/5/2016	|My husband and I stopped here on the way back to Monticello from Westville (Go Sages!). He had a chocolate shake and I had a cookie dough tornado. Both were very tasty and refreshing. What a cute place filled with character. The service was very friendly and efficient. I love small town gems like this!|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	8/19/2015	|"Little piece of heaven, the best ice cream shop near Champaign Urbana. Decent prices, superb taste; What else do you need on a hot summer day! This place is cash only, and sometimes you can smell cow dung. Other than that, this place serves far better ice cream than neighboring ice cream parlors (like Jarlings) of Champaign-Urbana."|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|2|	7/26/2019|	"Went here for the 1st time tonight. I ordered a turtle tornado. It was excellent. TONS of pecans and lots of flavor. I guess I could be picky and say that it melted incredibly fast. Too bad my wife and son didn't have the same experience. My son ordered a plain chocolate cone. My wife ordered a vanilla cone w/ a chocolate dip. I tasted both, after they said theirs didn't taste very good. I totally agreed. Both were very watery in flavor. My sons had a bit of an icy consistency. Instead of ice cream or custard - they resembled ice milk. Not going back. Jarling's Custard Cup is way, way better."|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|4|	3/30/2015	|"Our bike club comes here often year round for evening ice cream cycling excursions from Champaign-Urbana. The staff is always VERY friendly and accommodating. The ice cream is tasty, although I do prefer the fattier taste of custard. All in all, a wonderful place to visit."|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	5/18/2018|	Best ice cream in the area! I love their featured flavor of the week! The staff is always very friendly and the service is generally pretty fast!|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	5/5/2018|	Delicious ice cream. Best soft serve I've ever had in my entire life. Staff is wonderful and friendly and even though they only have a few flavors it will leave you in a wonderful happy place and life will be good.|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|3|	9/4/2014|	"Local Dairy Barn that served your typical traditional American dairy products. The ice cream was itself was so rich that I could taste the milk. If you just simply want an ice cream or something simple, this is definitely a good place to go. But personally I see nothing too special about the place. There's ample amount of parking in their private lot, but expect there to always be full of locals populating the area. When in doubt, just make your own parking spot. I know I did"|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	7/22/2016	|The best soft serve hands down...no further explanation needed!! Every flavor...those that are constant or those that change weekly...LOVE. THE. BEST.|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5	|7/6/2016	|Best home made style ice cream. I stop by any time I am near Sidney and make special trips from my home 13 miles away from time to time.|
|https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney	|5|	7/6/2016	|"Definitely have to check out their facebook for the flavor of the week! We were there for coffee flavored and it was delicious. I have to go back to check out the lemon, as I have heard wonderful things about it. Definitely worth the drive if you're looking for something different than custard"|
