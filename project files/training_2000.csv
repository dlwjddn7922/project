All I can say is they have very good ice cream I would for sure recommend their cookies and creme ice cream it is very good,1
Nice little local place for ice cream.My favorite is their pumpkin shake ( Fall season special).( My Sweetness tolerance is low) Their LARGE SIZE ice cream usually seems too sweet after having ice cream for a while. But love their pina colada. So refreshing. Their Banana Split is good too.,1
A delicious treat on a hot day! Staff was very friendly and helpful-- gave us a sample and let us order a little earlier than open.,1
"This was great service and a fun crew! I got the banana cream pie with chocolate ice cream. I loved the flavor of this. It had freshly cut bananas, graham crackers and chocolate ice cream. YUM!! The only thing that I noticed is that it melted pretty fast and it's a bit icy. I like creamier ice cream (so it had a bit more overrun that I prefer), but overall, was delicious!",1
"This is one of my favorite places to get ice cream in the CU area. It's a bit of drive, but it is worth it. It's about 10 minutes from the far side of Urbana. Getting there is really easy. The atmosphere of the Dairy Barn is very kid friendly. There are many tables set up so that you can sit and enjoy the ice cream. When my friends and I went, the line was about a 20 minute wait, but it didn't seem like any time at all. An older gentlemen, I presume the manager or owner, was giving out samples to the entire line. You could tell that he took pride in the product he made and was excited to share it with everyone. The special that night was cappuccino ice cream. I added in cookie dough to make a ""tornado"" which is a blizzard like ice cream treat. It was so quite refreshing and was a nice treat on a humid night. The Dairy barn is a must go!",1
"I've been coming to this ice cream stand since I was a little girl back in the 1970's. (Yes, it's been here for that long! Just not under the same ownership.) But not much has changed in those years in regards to their basic ice cream. It is a great family place! They are always accommodating when we want to tweak the menu item a bit :-) I love the rotating, special flavor of the week! Keep an eye on the Facebook page for that. It's always a joy to see the near constant long line. Shows how successful a small town business can be. If you are truly passionate about supporting small business, stay away from those franchises that make their ice cream at some corporate factory and come get some made fresh soft serve from your truly local business!!",1
My husband and I stopped here on the way back to Monticello from Westville (Go Sages!). He had a chocolate shake and I had a cookie dough tornado. Both were very tasty and refreshing. What a cute place filled with character. The service was very friendly and efficient. I love small town gems like this!,1
"Little piece of heaven, the best ice cream shop near Champaign Urbana. Decent prices, superb taste; What else do you need on a hot summer day! This place is cash only, and sometimes you can smell cow dung. Other than that, this place serves far better ice cream than neighboring ice cream parlors (like Jarlings) of Champaign-Urbana.",1
"Our bike club comes here often year round for evening ice cream cycling excursions from Champaign-Urbana. The staff is always VERY friendly and accommodating. The ice cream is tasty, although I do prefer the fattier taste of custard. All in all, a wonderful place to visit.",1
Best ice cream in the area! I love their featured flavor of the week! The staff is always very friendly and the service is generally pretty fast!,1
Delicious ice cream. Best soft serve I've ever had in my entire life. Staff is wonderful and friendly and even though they only have a few flavors it will leave you in a wonderful happy place and life will be good.,1
The best soft serve hands down...no further explanation needed!! Every flavor...those that are constant or those that change weekly...LOVE. THE. BEST.,1
Best home made style ice cream. I stop by any time I am near Sidney and make special trips from my home 13 miles away from time to time.,1
"Definitely have to check out their facebook for the flavor of the week! We were there for coffee flavored and it was delicious. I have to go back to check out the lemon, as I have heard wonderful things about it. Definitely worth the drive if you're looking for something different than custard",1
"Much better than Champaign's Jarlings. Better service, better ice cream, and the lines usually significantly shorter. Worth the drive!!",1
Basically the best thing since sliced bread. Definitely worth the trip outside of Champaign!!,1
"I LOVE the Dairy Barn. 20 minutes east of CU, this is the picture perfect small town ice cream place. Outdoor, order at the window and sit on the picnic tables under the festive outdoor lighting to enjoy your soft serve treats. Chocolate and vanilla always available, with a rotating special third flavor (I love mint week!). There are always special tornadoes (think blizzard) to match the flavor of the week. I also recommend the raspberry truffle tornado; raspberry flavored ice cream with magic shell-like dipping chocolate mixed in. If you want a short journey and some awesome ice cream, go to Sidney Dairy Barn! Update: I love Dairy Barn. It should have 5 stars. What's my problem?",1
"This is still the best soft serve I know, in the world. My favorite flavors are mint and cherry. Their flavors are subtle, mild, and the cream is not overly sweet. Lately, the ice cream I've had at other ice cream establishments has been so sweet that it's actually inspired this positive review. I once finished a quart of Sidney Dairy Barn ice cream, in an afternoon, by myself. At other places I'll only have a small cup and I'll feel sick and renounce ice cream for a month -- how depressing. I don't know what else they do differently, but the milk is fresh and the flavors are right. It's basically a stand in the middle of corn fields - at last that's how I remember it - and they're only open during the summer. I always go out of my way to come to Sidney Dairy Barn and it's always a trip worth taking. P.S. CASH or CHECK only.",1
"This place is the bomb, and absolutely the kind of place that makes it worth searching around for the best local joints on a road trip. We spotted it on a hiking trip and made a stop on our way out, and it was flat-out amazing, as you could probably guess based on the long lines stretching out at dusk. The service was incredibly efficient for such a tiny joint, and they had a good selection of flavors; but the food was the real attraction, amazing ice cream desserts made from that fresh country cream that you can taste the minute it hits your tongue. It's also got 1970s prices, which makes the massive sugar rush all the more worthwhile.",1
"GREAT ice cream! It's a frequent trip for us from St. Joe. Don't be surprised by long lines, but they have a good routine and send the orders out very timely. You can't compare it to Jarlings, as that is frozen custard, but it's still very tasty. I like that the Facebook page posts their flavor of the week. Hope they stay around a long time!",1
Great little ice cream stand in Sidney. Delicious and inexpensive and excellent service from friendly staff! I highly recommend a stop and you too will be hooked!,1
"A local favorite! Very worth the drive, they are more than happy to make you whatever you can dream up! Like most soft-serve/custard places, they serve their regular flavors and a flavor of the week. Creme de mint is so tasty! But so are the fruity flavors. You can also catch the Moo-mobile at the Urbana Farmer's Market and other local events. I like their ice cream sandwiches but when I visit the Sidney location, only a chocolate dipped cone will do!",1
"Pro-tip: Definitely give the rotating ice cream flavors a try - they offer samples! The double scoop is worth the money if you're sharing with someone. Highlights: The female workers the night we went were super nice and so honest with their opinions about the ice cream flavors. They let us sample a few of them and then gave us the biggest double scoop! For sure worth $6. The ice cream itself was insanely good, very creamy, rich, and actually better than a ton of ice cream shops in the area. Lowlights: Some of the ice cream flavors on the menu weren't actually available which was a little disappointing.",1
"Great spot to drop by after a long day of volleyball and a good dinner. Convenient that they have boba drinks, ice cream, shakes, etc - something to please everybody! The girls opted for a Taro Milk Tea and the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade - both with boba. I chose the Chocolate Crumble Ice Cream cone. Everybody was happy with their choices & enjoyed the late night refreshment. If you haven't tried it out & your in the Tempe area, give it a shot & see what you think!",1
Nicely decorated spot for sweets and drinks! Good place to catch up with people or a quick stop to treat yourself. Got Vietnamese Coffee and Tiramisu ice cream and we LOVE the Vietnamese coffee! So good and strong with coffee flavor. Matcha Immuni-Tea: matcha was light but good if you like green tea. Butterfly Rose Lemonade: pretty and a refreshing drink. Would recommend!,1
The rose milk tea latte is my wife's favorite in AZ. I enjoy their immunity-teas. Haven't had an item I didn't like yet. Plenty of parking and seating at this location. The ice cream looks great too but I don't have much of a sweet tooth to try. Looks like you can get it mixed with your favorite cereal.,1
"Rewind has a trendy look, but the beauty isn't just skin deep. This is my go to boba place when I'm in Chandler. Layered drinks like the rose milk latte aren't just eye-catching on Instagram-- they're also delicious! I've tried their milk tea and their fruity tea, and they do both well. I would definitely bring anyone here, because they serve things like ice cream and can please people who don't like/aren't willing to try boba. It's also a little cheaper than some other boba places around here. Every time I've been here, the staff have been exceptionally nice. That, coupled with how quickly they make drinks, is what really makes them a five star establishment in my eyes. They also have a good variety of flavors, including non dairy and caffeine free choices, and the ability to customize sugar levels. Someday I'll get ice cream here, but their tea is so good that I haven't been able to not order it!",1
"I scrolled through Google to find the closest Boba place and found Rewind. It was so worth the 15 minutes! I LOVED EVERYTHING I ORDERED. The staff was so kind and friendly, the atmosphere was so calming. A good place to sit down and enjoy your boba. The decor is so aesthetically pleasing. It was so delicious, I almost cried it was gone. The rose milk latte was so fresh and sweet which is how I love my boba. I also tried the house coffee with rose cream (not pictured) was so good and refreshing. It was Literal perfection! I cannot wait to come back!",1
This ice cream was exceptionally good. I would so come back here next time I'm in PHX. Think of getting soft serve ice cream mixed in with you favorite cereal... this is the place to go!,1
"I love coming here. It's the first boba place I went to after moving to the valley. Their customer service is amazing, everyone is super kind every time. They have so many options. Delicious locally made ice cream with vegan options! The establishment is always clean and picture ready. There's not enough nice things to be said about Rewind.",1
This place was delicious! They had lots of vegan options. I didn't know vegan ice cream could taste like the real deal. They also had lots of options of non vegan ice cream as well. You can taste test them if you'd like. It's a little pricier but worth it!,1
Great service! Not your average ice cream stop but work a stop to try something different. Fun choices for kids and adults,1
"Craving some bubble tea? Be kind, visit Rewind! This shop is in the same plaza as Pokitrition, Culver's and Firehouse Subs so you can can get some food in addition to drinks and dessert if you so desire. The menu has a plethora of ice cream and bubble tea options. I opted for the brown sugar milk tea, mountain green immuni-T and a lychee peach green tea. I enjoyed every drink! The brown sugar milk tea had a good balance of sweetness + creaminess and had a hint of caramel undertone in it. I wanted it with boba but unfortunately it would have taken 30 minutes for them to make it. I personally think if you're a bubble tea shop you should always have boba ready and waiting for the customer during business hours, especially if the only mix in options for your drinks are boba or crystal boba. The immuni-T was filled with fresh ginger, lemon and honey. It was cool and refreshing with a bit of a kick to it from the ginger. I also enjoyed the lychee peach green tea, a delicate tasting and lightly sweetened drink. Service was good and I was happy with the sweetness amounts the bobarista recommended for each drink. I'll be back to try more if I'm in the area.",1
"There is a lot of variety at Rewind, from soft serve with mix-ins, various sweet tea concoctions, and scoop ice cream. I tried a vanilla swirl with Reese's peanut butter cups mixed in - kind of like a Blizzard at DQ, with banana slices on top. The ice cream was quite sweet. The presentation was nice with bananas strategically placed. It was very soft and started melting over my cup almost immediately even though it was a cold day so prepare to start eating right away.",1
"GREAT LOOKING ICE CREAM Went right up to the counter to order. There are many yummy sounding ice cream combinations but I got the Minion's Treat. I also decided to get the Thai Tea Crush. There were a lot of people that ordered before me but everyone's ice cream came out in a timely manner. The ice cream gets blended with your choice of mix-ins. Personally I thought there was not enough mixed in as not every bite was flavorful. Even though every bite was not packed with bananas and Frosted Flakes, it was still good. The Thai Tea Crush was good but a bit watery for me. Overall, try it out if you want a cold instagramable looking treat.",1
This spot is definitely in my top 5 for Thai tea. I ordered my Thai tea at 50% sweetness and I'm happy I did because their boba was surprisingly pretty sweet which was a great surprise. Probably some of the best boba I've had. Thai tea had great flavor. My only complaint was the cashier taking the order. When we were ready to order he just looked at us and didn't say a word. Not sure what his deal was but he needs some more training on customer service. Gotta stop by here if you like Thai tea though.,1
"Dropped by Rewind on a weekday and was not disappointed in the least! I love strawberry matcha drinks and was so used to being able to find them all over the Bay. However, I hadn't really found a good place to grab one in AZ. I ordered the strawberry matcha with boba at 75% sweetness. First off, the boba was great! It had the perfect chewiness and was sweet without being overly sugary. Definitely a plus point here. The drink itself was good though the strawberry was a bit more artificial than I liked. It also was not as rich as I am used to so that was the only tiny critique I had. Overall, this place is cute and the drinks are delicious. Service is friendly as well. I will definitely be back to try other menu items including the ice cream which looked scrumptious! In regards to Covid, it was great to see everyone wearing masks. There is seating outside with spaced tables if you would like to brave the heat and sip your drinks before heading home. Parking is quite easy within the complex so you can attempt to drink your tea in the car instead of melting as well.",1
This is a very popular place. There was a lot of foot traffic in and out which was a good sign. They have a simple menu and easy to understand. Ambiance inside was nice and bright. Seating is limited. There is outdoor seating but very limited as well. The staff were great. They explained the menu what the new flavors were and the wait time for everything. They provide samples if needed and the amount of ice cream is a good amount. The shakes are great even the coconut I was great in place of vanilla. It would be good to have more flavors available for the shakes. There are a good amount of choices for the boba. Looking forward to coming,1
"Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try. I have been here for both ice cream and boba drinks. They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time.",1
"So happy my brother and sister-in-law sent over a little surprise from Rewind. Now I have this place on my list. Drinks were super yummy. The Thai tea was delicious and is always a good drink to default on when you're having a hard time choosing from all the other milk teas. I'll have to stop in to see the rest of the menu but I'm confident that they'll be just as good as the three that were delivered. Also, their quality does not lack as you can see from the photos. The drinks traveled well.",1
"One of my favorite local ice cream spot! They always shave delicious drinks, boba and coffee. My personal favorite order is the: vanilla ice cream infused with fruity pebbles and I usually add boba as a topping in a cup. Sometimes they get confused if you ask for boba as a topping, but ask for it in a cup and it should be ok! The brown sugar milk tea and rose milk tea latte are my go to drinks. Their butterfly rose lemonade is pretty good too! Very refreshing and perfect for Instagram pictures. They also have so many different matcha drinks!",1
"Been in AZ for 3 weeks now and have been impressed by all the tea shops around! From Rewind I went bold and got the matcha coffee, which I usually don't get when I go to tea shops that have them! Also went with a safe jasmine milk tea. The Jasmine milk tea at 50% sugar was perfect for my husband and I, whereas the matcha coffee at 50% sugar was too sweet. Will probably get 25% sweetness for that one next time but overall this place was really good!",1
"My husband and I were on our way home from grocery pickup and decided to get a quick treat from Rewind. After much deliberation, I decided on the Rose Milk Latte and my husband ordered the Hojicha Latte. The employees were friendly and speedy in getting our drinks made and out to us, especially appreciated during these times! My Rose Milk Latte was as expected; definitely had a subtle Rose flavor and at 75% sweet, was a good amount of sweetness ... I only ordered the smaller size last time, but would probably get the large next time. I had gotten my drink with the crystal boba which was pretty difficult to find. Not sure what the normal amount is but the quantity I received left me wishing there was more. The Hojicha Latte had a very distinct flavor, almost earthy. Probably would not get this one again but this drink had much more boba than mine. Overall, a cute litte spot. They have a variety of tea drinks, ice creams, shakes, and so on. More like a 3.50 star review for this experience but rounding up to 4.",1
"This place is so good! I love an ice cream place where you can customize your flavor and Dripps does that to perfection! The best part of it is they use cereal flavors blended into the ice cream and then you can add toppings to add to the delicious ice cream you created. I got the Captain Crunch Berries ice cream blend with gummy bears. Perfectly creamy ice cream that tastes freshly made with just the right amount of cereal flavors throughout the ice cream. The best part is they have a wide choices of cereals from frosted flakes to Apple Jack's to name a few. We also tried out a few of teas like the Matcha and the Rose tea. Both are delicious, not too sweet and very Instagramable looking! It's a must to add boba to the drink. Good here to get your treats on cause this place is one of the best in Arizona!",1
"YES YES YES! This place was so good. I had heard about it from a news article because of they way the ""drill"" the ice cream to mix and serve it. We went and I got an ice cream with cinnamon toast mixed in and brownie bites on top. My friends got milkshakes. It was all super tasty and delicious. I felt the portion size to price was affordable for the milkshake but I felt the price was a bit high for the amount of ice cream you got; although it was really tasty. My only complaint about this place, although it would only stop me if there were really long lines, was that the service was kind of slow. After ordering it took about 10 to 15 minutes to get our ice cream and two shakes. There was only one person before us that came in. The people who came in after us had to wait a few minutes before their order was taken. Again, it would not stop me from coming back and the flavor was really good but the wait time, I felt, is an area for improvement and maybe would push me away if there were long lines.",1
I was really impressed with my whole experience at Rewind! The employees greeted me with kindness and did a fantastic job in explaining the items on their menu. I ordered the matcha ice cream and it turned out to be very delicious. I also love the setting inside where you can get some pretty cool pictures. I wish more ice cream spots shared the same energy as the folks from Rewind do. I'll be coming back for more!,1
I'm impressed! Only had their drinks but both times it was very delicious. Had the matcha strawberry and pink crush. Decent prices and quality drinks!,1
i'm a fan! i stopped here for a quick dessert date with a girlfriend of mine and we both got one drink and one ice cream creation each! i decided to create my own using their vanilla base with fruity pebbles mixed in and topped with more fruity pebbles. it was soooo good. it was dense and creamy - loved that the ice cream didn't start to melt right away too. I also tried their Pink Cloud drink and presentation-wise it was 5/5. Unfortunately I didn't try it before my ice cream so I couldn't get the true flavor or taste of the drink. :( that just means i'll need to come back though! Would def recommend if you're in the area.,1
Rewind has super delicious drinks. I tried the sweet matcha with crystal boba (they ran out of black boba sadly) and it tasted just like it's from Japan! Staff was friendly and I can't wait to go back to try more of their yummy creations!,1
It's Valentines Day and me without a Valentine decided to treat myself with a big ol' ice cream cone. Not something I do often so this is big. I walk in and there's about 4 people waiting (6 ft apart) and the folks behind the counter were hoofing it! Their fabulous creations went quickly by and I give my order after a little wait. Hand made is worth a small wait. I've been here for tea though this time my Minions Favorite ice cream cone blew my socks off. Frosted Flakes in little pieces inside my ice cream groovy! You gotta try this place. I live in the neighborhood and supporting small businesses is a priority for me. I'll keep coming back because they're worth it!,1
Pretty fast service for this COVID19 situation w limited workers. The employees are super friendly and they have plenty of disinfectants when you walk in. Clean environment and the boba is amazing like always. Any matcha drinks and the brown sugar boba are amazing. I also appreciate the milk substitutes available.,1
"Weekend of firsts! Happened into this place because we tried the sushi burrito place in the same strip mall. Young lady explained the options so went with Minion's Treat (ice cream, Frosted Flakes, banana)...so good! Frosted Flakes are mixed into the ice cream along with banana. Whole think mixed together and topped with more flakes and few banana slices. Talk about decadent in a cup! Wife had the Thunder Buddies (Reese's Puff, banana mixed in and topped with almond slices, bananas and Teddy Grahams). So yummy and fun concept!",1
"I came here for the second time last week for bubble tea. The first time I visited, my brother and I came in to try the cereal-infused ice cream I had read about. I had ordered the Thunder Buddies and he ordered a Cookies and Cream shake. I'm not going to lie, I wanted to steal his milkshake after trying it!! Both visits, the staff was very quick to greet me and will offer to explain the menu if you haven't been there before. This time there was a girl working behind the counter and I asked her about the Brown Sugar Milk Tea sweetness. She had a sample that she was able to offer me and indicated that she could make it more or less sweet. The sample was the perfect amount of sweet! I went ahead and order that with boba added. I'm definitely a fan and would come back and try it again!",1
"Drinks were quickly made and very tastyy, cured my boba cravings l. The shop was cute inside as well :))",1
"We usually come to this place to eat ice cream. Their ice cream is so good, it doesn't have egg smell like other ice creams.",1
"My dilemma coming here is always if I should get ice cream or a drink (and should I get that drink with boba). Today I got ice cream with cocoa krispies (its blended into the ice cream- yummy and unique), topped with graham crackers and honey drizzle - so good! Perfect for hot day too. My husband got the Cookies & Cream which he really enjoyed. The staff here is friendly and helpful when it comes to giving suggestions. This has definitely turned into one of my favorite dessert spots. I look forward to coming back and maybe trying a drink next time.",1
"Absolutely great sweet matcha latte here. I will be coming here constantly. They have a rewards program as well. Boyfriend got the banana butterfinger vanilla cone and he likes his as well (he's pretty picky, glad they didn't mess up his ice cream ). Good customer service as well! Thank you guys!",1
"I'm a big fan of Oreos and when given the chance, will mix that into my ice cream 9 times out of 10. This is hands down my favorite place for Oreo ice cream. Dripps does it different. You can choose a cereal or cookie and they will crush it into the ice cream in the shop. What you end up with is this thick, creamy concoction of your favorite mix in + ice cream that stays true to taste! I've tried their ice cream and a few of their drinks and liked it all!",1
"So aesthetic and delicious ice cream! My boyfriend and I shared the cookies and cream ice cream in a cup and it was very good. My second time going I got the vegan coconut ice cream so people who are dairy free like me can also enjoy! I got the coconut ice cream as a base, Oreos as my mix in, and cookie dough as my topping and it tasted SO GOOD. I recommend getting things in a cone because it seems you get more for your money",1
Delicious vegan ice cream and drinks are so aesthetically pleasing! The interior is cute and great place to just hangout.,1
Visited from Cali- it's the only boba place I went to in AZ and I miss it! Really wish they had one here too,1
"I'd like to start off by saying I've been here 3 times in the past week. Each time, I got a different drink and each one was excellent. The service has been great, all the people I've seen working have been kind and it's very clean and cutely decorated inside! The vegan options are awesome and I'm so happy that a lot of their popular drinks are dairy free by default without having to ask. I love floral flavors like lavender and rose, so their rose milk latte is amazing and their honey lavender ice cream is PERFECT, Most places never put ENOUGH lavender into things, but this had great flavor. I've brought my wife and also recommended to my coworkers, we all work up the road. Please consider coming to Gilbert/Mesa so I can enjoy closer to home!!! Love this place.",1
"I have been meaning to try Rewind after realizing how close it was to Pokitrition. They serve boba and ice cream (have to go back for the ice cream!) but the boba I had was amazing. Against my better judgement, I had a blended boba tea rather than my usual milk tea. I got the Brown Sugar Crush. Absolutely delicious. VERY sweet, but delicious nonetheless. If you have a sweet tooth, this might be the drink for you. In addition to boba it has custard at the bottom of the drink, which I normally get as an additional add-on. Will be going back for sure! Gotta try that ice cream next!",1
"Okay I am Dripps regular now and I have to go with 5 stars. Be it their ice cream or tea they are incredible. Not only do they boast of Instagram worthy pics but they are unbeatable in the taste wise too. They are sisters from Pokitrition and must say they know what works. Eat at Pokitrition and get 20% off at dripps. I have tried their thunder, Oreo, minions icecreams and each one is different from the other and totally good. Their rose milk latte is my fav, the Flavors are so good and it's definitely for the rose lovers. Overall a must place, though their price range is over the top, it's definitely worth it.",1
"Well - they don't scrimp on the toppings like DQ has been doing lately. I drove by here when I missed my turn into the Whole Foods parking lot and decided that I needed to go in and check out the ""craft"" soft serve ice cream. Especially when I read so many good reviews from other yelpers. I don't normally get a milkshake when I get ice cream, as they are so quick and easy to drink that they don't last long enough for me. But I decided to get one here as the pictures I saw made them look soooo good. I went with Oreo as my topping and chocolate ice cream. I saw the clerk put a huge scoop of ice cream in the drill machine with a big pile of Oreo cookie crumbles and some milk, and it looked like I would be eating for days. But after it was all blended, it went into a 12 or 16 ounce cup with an inch on the top for her add even more Oreo chunks, so there was not a lot of shake. It would have been great if she had given me the sidecar like you get in the metal containers at diners rather than just throw out the yummy leftovers. And I never thought I would say this, but it was just too much Oreo for me. I also think I missed out on the yumminess of the high fat ice cream experience that everyone talks about by having it put into a milkshake. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get an ice cream cone, maybe with Reese's mixed in.",1
"<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Bomb.com</a> Try the fruity pebbles milk shake. It is absolutely amazing. The soft serve is good too. We tried the coco puffs mix and it did not disappoint. The location is clean and instagram worthy.",1
"I had tried this whole cereal mixed with ice cream craze in LA a few months back and was so stoked to see it pop up in AZ! I'm a fan of boba and my girlfriend loves cereal and ice cream so we were excited to check it out. The best of both worlds. The shop is new - really cute and definitely hit the mark when it comes to an instagrammable vibe. Neon sign on the wall, pretty drinks, ice cream with toppings, they know what they're doing. I saw lots of photos being taken. Service was incredibly friendly. We were asked if it was our first time and given a quick rundown of both menus: the ice cream and the tea/drinks. I went with a 16oz milk tea and added boba ($.50). My girlfriend got captain crunch ice cream in a cone topped with strawberry and sprinkles. The milk tea was average and the boba was solid. It was a little too sweet for my taste. Other places will let you pick your sweetness flavor.. didn't get the option here but maybe you just have to ask? It wasn't bad but I'd probably stick to ice cream next time if I'm going to get a lot of sweetness anyways. That's just my personal preference though! They have some really pretty signature drinks (rose milk tea, some type of lemonade) so there are other options on that front. The ice cream flavor was spot on and really tasty. You get a large portion of ice cream so don't be afraid to share, and don't feel bad if you can't finish. There were a couple larger chunks of cereal on the ice cream that tasted a little stale but overall it was quite the treat. We will definitely be back again after they have been open a little longer to try more items.",1
Love love love! I can't believe I never popped in before! The hostess was super nice and gave us a lot of info on everything! We got the minions treat and it was superb. I wasn't sure if I'd like the cereal topping but surprisingly it tasted really good with the ice cream. I'm definitely going to return!,1
"YUM! I went when they offered a BOGO free scoop of their ice cream. It was delicious! If you've ever been to Carmela in LA, I would say this is very similar and better than Salt and Straw. You can taste the yumminess and real flavors. Wasn't too creamy or lacking in flavor. Just perfect combination. They are allowing you to sample so I ended up choosing lavender and raspberry chocolate truffle. Delish! Girls working were super nice and helpful though they seemed a bit overwhelmed by the customers coming in and didn't have their groove exactly down. The place is small and cute and has seating inside and outside. There's a bathroom in the back. Lots of parking and other places to eat in same plaza. I wouldn't mind going back. Its only $4 a scoop so not bad on pricing either. Also, great customer service cuz when I got my ice cream I saw what looked like a hair but wasn't exactly sure so I asked the girls and they weren't sure but offered to remake right away which I thought was really great service:)",1
One of my fav dessert places. Really cute and chic Staff is always friendly Love all the ice cream options My fav drink is most definitely the matcha strawberry latte.. sooooo goood !,1
"So I'm a matcha green tea fan and it's so hard to find around here! But little did I know that there's this place hidden in the cuts of chandler, REWIND! It's one of the only places that has a huge variety of matcha infused drinks!! I drive 22 minutes just to have a taste! Can't wait til they open up another location in Scottsdale!!! La Vida Matcha!",1
Loved this place. I had the milk rose latte with coconut milk. They do different percentages of sugar! Also can't wait to go back and get their brown sugar test,1
"Love that they have vegan options! Seriously some delicious and unique flavors, awesome toppings, and a wide array of sugary treats that could fit anyone's needs.",1
I'm from the Bay Area and my parents just moved to the area. This place popped up and all the drinks and ice cream desserts looked so good! I ordered the Strawberry Matcha Latte and my boyfriend ordered the Butterfly Rose Lemonade. It was pretty packed on a Sunday Night at 7 pm. The staff was very friendly. This place is so cute! Modern and Chic Decor. Definitely a lot of photo ops lol The Strawberry Matcha Latte was delicious and aesthetically pleasing. It tasted just as good and identical as Boba Guys back home. I tried my boyfriends Butterfly Rose Lemonade and it was very refreshing as well. I'm not a fan of Rose flavored items but the Lemonade definitely overpowered the hint of Rose. I'd definitely come back. Everything just looks so appetizing and pretty.,1
Fun place to try different flavor combos. We had chocoholic and frooty tooty and loved both. Waffle cones are fresh and yummy as well. Service is great!! Very clean.,1
"Dripps is a deeeelight! Ever since I saw their sign go up with the words soft serve + tea, I've been so excited and anxiously waiting for them to launch. I was hoping they would specialize in Asian drink teas and boba as we don't have anything like that in this particular corner of Chandler, and to my pleasant surprise, they do! I popped by during their grand opening night where they were offering Buy One Get One on all ice cream and drinks. It was a bit of a wait but well worth it. I decided to get two drinks to try, and it was so hard choosing as ALL the drinks sound and look amazing. Got the Strawberry Matcha latte and Rose Milk Tea. Both so good, with the Rose Milk Tea being floral and sweet (best when mixed) and the Strawberry Matcha having delicious fresh strawberry purÃ©e at the bottom. Can't wait to try their other concoctions like Matcha Cold Brew and Roasted Green Tea Hojicha latte! Their decor is *aesthetic* af and there are plenty of spots to get a good snap of your pretty drinks and cones. I especially love the tropical wallpaper and hexagonal marble tile in their kitchen area!! So pretty. Can't wait to come back and try the soft serve - I saw on insta that they have extended their BOGO deal for a few more days (show that you're following them on social media to redeem!) so I might have to go back and get a cone! (Summer's over and so is my theoretical summer bod lol)",1
"Great service, pretty atmosphere & delicious boba drinks. They're hardworking here and make amazing drinks! Totally recommend :)",1
"The matcha ice cream was AMAZING! The matcha bubble tea was okay but better to go for 75% or 50% sweet. Tip, mix the matcha ice cream with pecan, you won't regret!",1
"My favorite shake spot! I don't know what it is but im addicted to the shakes here, I tried replicating my favorite shake at home (the strawberry shortcake one) and man it just wasn't the same I don't even mind though because paying for the shakes here is definitely worth it",1
"This place was so yummy, worth the price they give you so much ice cream, also it doesn't hurt that the location and food is aesthetically pleasing. Would definitely go back to try more flavors and drinks.",1
"The Iced Matcha Latte was what caught my attention. Unfortunately, there is only one size for that particular drink 16 oz. Hint, hint make 24 oz available for coffee/matcha lovers like me! They also have ice cream with a variety of cereal and toppings you can blending into your ice cream. I haven't had a change to try it yet. Looks interesting, but I am more of a sweet drink person. Cute decor in the shop an friendly staff.",1
"Best. Boba. In the area. I moved here from the OC which has the best boba on the west coast, don't @ me. So I searched a whole YEAR to find a decent boba place and I had settled... UNTIL I DISCOVERED REWIND. Their menu is small but everything is soooo good. The drinks are delicious and aesthetically pleasing. They have ice cream too which looks delicious and they have a really cute cereal concept, but I hardly ever veer away from my usual Matcha with Strawberry boba (10/10 recommend) They let you choose your sweetness level too, which is a huge plus. I've tried the Thai Tea, Rose Tea, and Brown Sugar and they're all delicious. The only thing is that they're usually understaffed and getting your drinks takes a while which can suuuuck especially with COVID, but it's still 5 stars for me.",1
"What a fun place for ice cream!!! I've been here twice already and have sampled quite a few items since I bring my kids here each time. While most places have a variety of combo-ice creams, this place has become a major hub of cereal-infused goodness. Great location situated on the SWC of Ray Rd and the 101. And housed near Poketrition, Firehouse Subs and Culver's. This is a great spot to add a sweet option to this area. We typically stick to their signature items on their menu. Each signature item gives you the option of having it served in a cone, cup or milkshake style. We have done all 3, and really.....it depends what you prefer because they are all SO good!!! My favorite item has been ""Thunder Buddy"". Such a fun name to begin with if you are a ""Ted"" fan, but also the ice cream combo is so tasty if you are a peanut butter and banana fan. They have an excellent variety of cereals to choose from if you'd like to create your own cone or milkshake, plus every topping you can imagine. Their menu also boasts a large variety of milk and bubble teas. I haven't tried them yet, but since their menu is so extensive, it may take me a while to try one. Prices are typical for this kind of treat. We usually pay $7 for their signature ice cream combos. Totally worth it when you see how much you get. They are very generous with the infused ingredients as well as the toppings. If you are a fan of places that are insta-worthy, this is one of them. They have a cute vined wall with neon lights for pics as well as some fun tropical wallpaper surrounding the interior. Fun place to visit with friends or to take kids. Looking forward to trying more items off their menu.",1
The drinks here are so creative and so good! I love the ice cream here as well because the mix ins are crunched up and goes great with the ice cream! I love the butterfly rose lemonade but everything I've gotten from here has been pretty great! I love that they're open right now with everything going on! And they provide hand sanitizer AND sanitizer wipes! A little on the pricey side for the drinks but worth it!,1
"WARNING - Part of this is a copy and paste of the caption from my food insta (which, btw, you should follow me on it's @blairs.eats lol) I am from Tucson but often drive up to Tempe for school related things and I loooooveeee to eat, especially since there's not a ton of variety in Tuctown! I went to Rewind because I'm almost always craving boba and it's the only thing I'm willing to branch out of my comfort zone on. I couldn't decide what I wanted so I got two drinks! The strawberry matcha latte and rose milk latte. They're both sooo good and amazing! Not like what we have in Tucson but I'm not knocking either. The matcha is refreshing with a citrusy kick thanks to the strawberry and the rose surprisingly, actually tastes like rose! 10/10 would drive 100+ miles again. I'll definitely come back again when I'm in Tempe again!",1
"We absolutely love this place! I would drive across town for them! I adore the idea of my favorite cereal in a soft served! The concept is very unique for a dessert shop in Arizona! When it comes to their drinks... their Butterfly Lemonade is my favorite! Very refreshing and light! Honestly, I don't know what some of these people are talking about when they say their customer service is bad. I never had a bad experience here and the staff have all been very friendly to us.",1
"Came here during their soft opening and the ice cream is absolutely delicious. You choose a mix-in (various cereals) which gets blended into a vanilla ice cream base and then gets topped with your choice of toppings. The texture is soft and creamy and the blended mix-ins weren't too chunky or gritty. We chose cinnamon toast crunch, which added a lot of flavor to the ice cream itself. I tried a couple of my friends' drinks and they were all aesthetically pleasing (basically, Instagrammable). The teas were quite strong and floral, so if that's not your thing I would skip them. The inside is really well decorated and the ice cream and drinks came out pretty quickly given they're probably still learning some things on the fly. I'll definitely be back often as it's probably some of the best ice cream I've had in the East valley. Like their sister shop (Pokitrition), I can see this place maintaining their high quality and introducing some exciting things in the future.",1
Oooohhh. THIS place is so very good. I love ice creams especially a rootbeer float. I did not go here for rootbeer floats but the ice cream is the best. The pumpkin pie ice cream is the best I ever had. You get what you pay for and you are definitely paying for a great tasting awesome ice cream. My new favorite ice cream spot!!!,1
"I came into this evening for some ice cream and i ended up adding the Butterfly coconut to my scoop of Bourbon ice cream. The ice cream had an amazing unique flacor, and the butterfly coconut was beautiful to look at and it tasted really good for a coconut lover. They have a lot of vegan flavors and options. Ill be back.",1
"Super happy to have finally given this place a try. I went to a very similar shop in NYC & was only hoping for this take on ice cream to spread. I got Frosted Flakes ice cream topped with snickers & teddy grams--soooo good! I was nervous the Frosted Flakes would be really sweet, but it wasn't too much at all. Honestly some of my favorite ice cream now--everyone should try it!",1
"The aesthetic there is great! So cozy and modern. They have a variety of Teas to choose from. Also you can choose how sweet you want it and I think that's great if you want your tea less sweet. The price for the Tea is great. I get Thai tea with boba and that's under 5 dollars. I've tried the Thai, brown sugar, and chai. Personally chai isn't my favorite but my bf really liked it. But the Brown sugar and Thai were really good and yummy! Overall a really great place to get Boba Tea from and you cannot go wrong with the prices there.",1
"Great place, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff. They offer a great assortment of teas and coffees as well as vegan ice cream which is a nice change!",1
Their boba is best!! Just right. Not too melt or not too hard. And Ice creams are amazing. We love this place.,1
"Came in for the first time recently and the cashier explained took her time to explain the drinks thoroughly. I ordered the rose milk latte, strawberry matcha latte and matcha coffee, all with 50% or 75% sweetness. The matcha flavor could be a little stronger, but other than that, the drinks matched its level of aesthetics. However, I had to wait around 15-20min for my drinks to be made. I visited this shop again for the second time but decided to order ahead via grubhub to make it more convenient. This time, I ordered the Thai tea and jasmine milk tea, both at 50% sweetness. Even with 50%, the drinks were extremely sweet so I recommend opting for less sweetness.",1
sooooooo good. i got a taro crush and it wasn't taro-y enough for me but it was delicious. i want to go back and try their ice cream and other drinks. they were super quick and friendly!,1
"Strawberry matcha latte with boba is AMAZING. Not too sweet at all, the only sweetener is from the purÃ©ed strawberry. Captain crunch milkshake was so so good.",1
"Came here during soft opening on a whim when I was in Chandler and I'm so happy I found this place on Yelp! The interior is akin to many tea places in LA, and the staff are so incredibly nice. The girl at the counter took time to explain the menu to us and seemed genuinely interested in their drinks. We ended up going with the rose milk tea and iced matcha latte. Both were sooo good. The rose milk tea is sweet and smells of naturally fragrant rose. It might be a little too sweet/syrupy for some though. The matcha was also absolutely perfect and didn't taste watered down at all. Their prices are competitive as of now, here's to hoping they don't increase significantly as they gain popularity. I'd totally come back here if I'm in the chandler area.",1
Delicious high quality drinks! Love them! They even had amazing hot coco bombs around Christmas time.,1
"Adorable little dessert place and heaven for those who are looking for cute backdrops for pics for Instagram while holding the most adorable and artistic looking drinks. I got the butterfly rose lemonade. It definitely looks better than it tastes, but it's worthy of a cute insta snap. They have tons of matcha options. Unfortunately, I'm not a matcha fan, but I would bring my matcha friends here to try some of their drinks. The staff is super friendly. She answered all my questions and offered me samples to try. She even wouldn't let me leave until I was completely satisfied with my drink .",1
"Apparently they had to change their name to Rewind from Dripp, but this place was made to be Instagrammed with fitting backdrops and bright, colorful drinks for pictures. I'm sure there will be a Black Mirror episode next season about the culture of going to a restaurant or cafe for the 'gram, but I digress. All that aside...the ice cream and drinks are as beautiful on the inside as on the outside. I mean that quite literally with how they infuse the cereal into the ice cream. I was expecting something similar to Cold Stone where chunks of mix-ins are spread out in the ice cream, but they have a cool machine setup that drills your cereal choice down to distribute it homogeneously throughout the ice cream. I got vanilla ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch mixed in and Reeses cups on the top. We all agreed the CTC was the perfect mix-in because when ground to a powder form you get a perfect flavor of cinnamon and sugar mixed in with the creamy ice cream. It also paired well with the Reeses on top. It definitely surpassed my expectations and it is a neat concept overall! My girlfriend got boba because when boba is presented as an option, she can not or will not choose anything else. She had an iced matcha latte with boba and I thought it was pretty good. The matcha flavor was very strong without being overpowering. My friend got a butterfly rose lemonade and it was tasty, the rose flavor was subtle. I personally would not order it because it was essentially more expensive lemonade with some subtle flavors, but if you are one to Instagram your drinks, the butterfly rose is a great model for photos.",1
So fresh and delicious for ice cream and matcha drinks! I am so excited to find this. So good to take kids and adults here especially in this hot Arizona weather. What a nice dessert place and it's under $10 for gourmet dessert with premium ingredients. The matcha tea here taste exactly what I had in Japan!!! I love it and definitely will return.,1
"Came through drippin' drip drip. Being a big boba tea aficionado, I was drawn to their drinks. Their strawberry matcha latte is absolutely incredible with homemade strawberry sauce and made on the spot matcha tea. It is reminiscent of The Boba Guys in SF. Their boba is just the right amount of chewiness, which can oftentimes be over cooked or made soggy. I've also tried their matcha latte which is equally as delicious! Their ice cream is quite the creative concept where breakfast cereal is melded into the soft serve. They have a plethora of cereals you can pick from to create a treat drawing memories from childhood. I will definitely be back soon!!",1
"Yummy ice cream for sure. I had the Oreo mix with a bit of chocolate drizzle and strawberries. I'm not a fan of cereal in my ice cream so opted out of that. They also have boba teas, and lemonades. This is a cute little ice cream spot. Return factor is high.",1
"Short Review: An odd boba shop to sum up. I will go more into details down below, but for this section, I'll just say their ice cream was delicious, the milk tea was good, and the inside of the shop is very sleek and clean and smells nice. Service was good too. Long Review: Rewind - Ice Cream + Boba Tea is a shop that specialize in dessert drinks and ice cream. But here is what's odd, they sell CEREAL! That's right, you heard me right, they offer breakfast cereal at a boba shop. I have never heard of such shop before until now. I honestly, don't know how it works, like do they just serve ordinary cereal where they just pour regular 2% or whole milk with retail bought cereal? I didn't ask because I'm not a cereal guy, but it would certainly be interesting if they offered milk tea boba cereal or something. Moving on, the inside has a nice beige cream overall interiors that makes it a pleasant sight to see. For menu, there are four categories: Teas, Ice Cream, Milk Shake, and Cereal. I got a Rose Milk Tea and Vanilla infused with matcha and almonds soft-serve ice cream. I don't care for cereal and while milk shake does sounds nice, I was more curious about their milk tea section at that time. It took about 3 minutes for my Rose Milk Tea and another 3 minute for my ice cream. Rose Milk Tea With Boba: I was intrigue by the gradient color layer of the drink. If that's their intention, then well done. It also taste fairly good for something that looked overly hyped. The taste reminds me of fruit loops cereal with lavender tea with milk and floral from the tea itself. When the drink is blended together, the color will change into light purple or lilac color. As for the boba, I was a little disappointed. The taste was good, but the chew was okay, but the worse part was the boba was stuck together into chunks. It was impossible to suck the rest of the boba even with boba straw. I'm guessing whoever cooked the boba, didn't stir it enough, and as a result, the boba get stuck together like that. Vanilla Soft-Serve Ice Cream With Matcha Infused + Almonds: At first, I was confused because I thought there were only two flavored ice, which was vanilla and chocolate, but I was wrong. You have two other steps which involved infused flavor and toppings for last. Any other extra will cost more, so keep that in mind. But anyway, this soft-serve ice was insanely good. As I eat this soft-serve ice cream over a hot summer season, my mind melted away. Such delicate, soft, smooth, and creamy consistency and texture. I was blown away at how good it was. And I have ate soft-serve in Disneyland, which was seriously good. Rewind, by far did the best soft-serve ice cream as far as I can tell. Although, the matcha infused was subtle, it still was a delightful treat that is hard to beat. Overall, I rate the quantity for milk tea/ice cream a B/A and in quality a -A/A+. Milk tea quantity is the same as many other boba shop. Price vs portion ratio are often the same. For ice cream, you get loads of ice cream at a great deal. For quality, Rose Milk Tea was great, but boba was terrible. Ice cream, by far, one of the best I've had, so it get an A+. It has a chance of reaching S rank, but the matcha was too subtle. If the matcha was a little stronger, I would give the ice cream an S rank. Otherwise, I gotta try their milk shake next time, now that I know their soft-serve is delicious.",1
Omg matcha mixin with fruity pebbles! Very helpful staff! I'm going to be back! Great atmosphere and music.,1
It was delicious definitely going back a lot to pick from but it's all yummy and the service was great,1
"Needed ice cream on a hot humid monsoonal day. My lunch was underwhelming and I needed ice cream to soothe my soul. I found Rewind here and it was close, the menu looled interesting, so I drove on over. The parking lot was quite full as it was the lunch hour and people were going to eat their lunch. I walked in and was the only person having dessert! The young woman behind the counter was super friendly and nice. Answered all my questions and gave me suggestions. I ended up choosing the Minion on a cone. I mean who doesn't love Minions? When my cone was presented to me it was a work of art. A beautiful, delicious, work of art. I sat on the couch, relaxed, and enjoyed my ice cream. I cannot wait to come back!",1
Love love love this place! We used to come here when it was drips and really enjoyed their matcha tea! The staff is always friendly and the location is easy to get to.I love trendy places and the backdrop for photos is so cute. We went on Saturday to try their ice cream and I had the Reese's Puffs! I was so delicious and they topped it off very nicely with Marshmallow Charms. I will be back!,1
"Dripp it like it's hot! Dripp is the newest concept from the gang at Pokitrition but now they are serving up classic Boba and Cereal infused ice cream! Today was their Grand opening and people came out in droves. The wait was a bit but it was worth it. They offer Matcha direct from Japan, infused in several drinks as well as some other classics. I got the sweet Matcha and my husband got the Hojicha Latte. The sweetness from the whipped cream along with the Matcha was a perfect combination. The Hojicha was a nice taste since the Matcha was toasted. Their most expensive drink is the Coconut Matcha but that is because it is served in a coconut. So if you want a fun and refreshing aesthetic, hit it up! The ice cream, was absolutely delicious. You can create your own or they have 9 signature creations. Starts with a vanilla base, choose from one of 17 cereals to mix with the ice cream and last but not least, choose your toppings. We chose to do two of the signature ice creams. The cookies and cream along with the frooty tooty. The have a cool machine that blends at high speed, really helps to mix it all up. Overall, the Frooty Tooty was not only gorgeous but so tasty! The fruity combination with the strawberry syrup was delectable. Lastly, the cookies and cream was super creamy and adorable. Make sure to snap a picture against their adorable leafy wallpaper or the aesthetically pleasing neon light/boxwood combination. Tons of free parking, a decent size for seating and a great new addition to the area. Now you have an excuse to eat cereal for dessert.",1
Amazingly delicious! I love blended Thai tea drinks with boba and Rewind definitely was up there. Variety of flavors and decent sizes. They have ice cream options too.,1
"My go-to ice cream spot in the area if I want a really high-quality treat. The sizes are quite large, so it feels absolutely worth the price when the quality is also considered. The inside ambiance is also very inviting and the staff is very friendly.",1
"Very yummy place! I got the one for regular price get one for a dollar special yesterday. Strawberry matcha is delicious as usual. The rose latte was something new I wanted to try. It was good but my only complaint is it wasn't sweet enough for me (75% sweet). It has a beautiful floral taste and the sweet element a was mostly concentrated in the pink layer. Still very yummy, just learned my lesson to make it a little sweeter next time since the rose flavor is very delicate.",1
"While in Chandler, Arizona we found this place on yelp! It's good. I couldn't decide if I wanted boba, ice cream or the milkshakeC and the cashier offered me a sample of the lychee peachy green tea. The lychee peachy green tea was very refreshing so I got that, but they were out of boba and I had to settle for the crystal boba. (Saddest part lol) My boyfriend got the Reese's Puffs milkshake, and that was delicious. I immediately regretted not getting that too. Service is friendly. Seating area is clean.",1
"Ice cream, you scream we all scream for Rewind Ice Cream!! I love the fresh made to order ice cream here. My favorite is the honey bunches of oats with honey teddy graham. My boys love it all! This time I tried their matcha and it did not disappoint. Very laid back atmosphere and the greenery wall is of course IG perfect! They also have drinks. I like again, not overly sweet so I prefer the coconut with matcha. The butterfly lemonade is very pretty but make sure you mix the drink well or else the syrup is at the bottom.",1
"Such a cute ice cream shop! Came here one night to try it out, and there were so many options! It took me a while to decide what I wanted, but I ended up ordering the Ice Cream Swirl with Lucky Charms and Graham crumbs, which was delicious. I also tried a few other flavors, and those were all great as well. I think one order is more than enough to share between two people, so it is definitely worth it! The workers are all really kind and helpful. Since it was my first time there, they answered all of my questions. The interior was also really nice too, especially the wall with the greenery and neon lighting. Overall, I will definitely return whenever I'm in the area. I can't wait to try other flavors!",1
"Dripps is a trendy little ice cream and tea shop branching from Pokitrition. Ambiance: A faux greenery back wall flashes bright LED lettering ""Dripp it like it's hot."" Absolutely Instagram-worthy surely attracting millennials including myself. Customers stayed behind waiting to lick their ice cream cones so they can take the perfect picture with the cute backdrop. Within hours of opening, many, many people have already posted pictures on social media. I think they did a good job of promoting the new place so many people who are active on social media were aware of it. Grand Opening: The grand opening of Dripps was this past Saturday, September 29th. The place was open from 4 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. My friend and I didn't want to wait so long in line, so we came after dinner around 8:30. The line was still super long! So congrats, Dripps Co., on the successful new venture. Your soft serves and colorful teas are a hit! All items were BOGO and will be BOGO for the first week since opening. Soft Serve Ice Cream: 1. Cup or Cone (one size only) 2. Mix-In: All soft serves are vanilla only and you can choose your favorite childhood cereal including Lucky Charms, Cap'n Crunch, Frosted Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Froot Loops, and many more, that they will blend in with the vanilla soft serve. 3. Toppings: You can choose from a list of toppings they have. Most of them are more dry cereal but a few toppings I spotted are the usual froyo toppings like cookie dough and crushed oreos. You can pay 50 cents extra for other toppings from a list that includes fruit and other yummies. Cup of Soft Serve w/ One Topping: I ordered the soft serve in a cup mixed with one of my favorite super sugary childhood cereals, Cap'N Crunch. I topped it with cheesecake bites, my go-to topping at froyo places. The combination was amazing. The ice cream is so rich and creamy, the amount that they serve is just enough. The cereal mixed in was a little crunchy and grainy, but still so delicious. I highly recommend the soft serves. I think even just the plain soft serve would have been tasty! Teas + Coffee: They also serve matcha teas, rose milk teas, matcha coffees, and thai tea. You can add boba to it if you like. I still need to try these, but I have heard from the other customers, that they do not disappoint. My next visit, I would love to try either the rose milk or matcha coffee. Everything is aesthetically pleasing, I'm sure the taste matches the beauty of these drinks as well!",1
"Its amazing matcha place ! Must visit if in chandler , variety of matcha item on the menu",1
"So happy to have found Rewind in my new neighborhood! The tea here is great! I've tried a few different drinks including lychee peach green tea, immuni-tea, butterfly rose lemonade (personal favorite) which have all been consistently delicious! I love the crystal boba!",1
They have good shakes and good Boba tea's and really friendly service. I like this place And so did my kids.,1
"Drinks are so beautiful and aesthetic! This is the perfect place to study if you could with friends. I got the butterfly strawberry lemonade and it was fruity and refreshing. Rose milk latte and pink crush were good as well, but I loooved the lemonade.",1
"gr8 thai tea, love that you could adjust the level of sweetness. very clean which is comforting, but also low staff which was no biggy. Katherine was bustin out drinks by herself during a mini rush which was pretty impressive",1
"For some reason I kept thinking...""be kind, rewind!"" (SuperStar) when I seen the name of the store. Tonight we came for the ice cream and it didn't disappoint. My bf and shared the cookies and cream on a waffle cone-it had your regular cookies and cream ice cream topped with Cookie Crips cereal and Coco Puffs. I love chocolate soooo this was perfect all around. This place sets itself apart from others by incorporating childhood cereals and oh so great memories. Granted my parents never got us the Cookie Crips because they were ""full of sugar"". Look at me now! Lol I'd come back again to try the boba teas! I give extra stars to places that have backgrounds for pictures! Bonus!",1
"Went in today and tried the Butterfly Rose Lemonade! First of all, WOW so eye pleasing! I didn't even want to mix it because it was so pretty. But I did and first sip, WHOA!! So sweet. Too sweet for me to be honest. But they have so many other drinks that I really want to try. If you love sweet, BRL is for you!!! If youre a plain iced tea kind of person, you won't like this. Lol I did try a sample of the Peach Lychee Green Tea and that was great. I will probably get that next time!",1
"This place was excellent! The boba is high quality, and they give out samples for some of the tea flavors- which I really appreciate!! I got the brown sugar milk tea (dairy free) with boba and it was great. Staff was also very knowledgeable about the flavors offered and their caffeine context. They also have tons of unique flavors, my boyfriend got a captain crunch milkshake and it was really good and we've never had anything else like it! The shop was also very clean and cute, great vibe! Highly recommend as a dessert or boba!",1
Yummmm. Came here because of the dairy free option of coconut milk. Interesting concept with the milk and cereal. I stuck with the classic cookie dough on a cone with added chocolate chips and this little cone had sooo much doughy goodness in it. Will be returning.,1
"I'm lactose but I'll come back regardless :) The concept is awesome and the staff is always stellar. They serve delicious customizable cereal ice cream cones, bowls, milk shakes, or straight up cereal bowls. Can't go wrong with capn crunch or special k. Be sure to get a drink to go with your ice cream. My favorites are the matcha latte and hojicha latte.",1
I'd give them 4.5 stars. The workers are always super nice. The place is clean even when it's busy on a Friday night. I got the cookies and cream milkshake which was the right amount of sweet. Usually it's super sweet but there's just hit the sweet spot,1
"This place was so awesome!! My sister & I were thinking of somewhere we could grab a dessert style drink or ice cream & this little gem popped up. It did not disappoint! My sister got the swirl ice cream in a cup with lucky charms cereal blended with the ice cream & lucky charms on top. I ordered the sweet matcha tea! Both were so delicious! I am typically not a fan of ice cream, but I have to say this was so good, I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend you stop in here and check it out for yourself. It's a very clean place and there are so many options when it comes to what you want. I want to try their strawberry cheesecake swirl next! Someone in front of us got it & it looked so good. The prices are fair, we paid just under $13 for both items, now thats a deal! Stop by & get your dripps on!",1
"Will definitely have to try Rewind again! I ordered the Matcha Americano and it hit the spot. Just a nice, refreshing drink where I could customize the sweetness. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Love, love, love that they are able to cater to vegans. There were four ice cream flavors. They also offered plant based milks. They do allow plant based milk subs for certain drinks at an additional cost. Tasted their blueberry cardamom ice cream which was delicious. Their cones and creations look amazing! Would definitely recommend trying.",1
"Dripps has been on my radar since I saw their sign up. They are coming in hot with a new trend a giant drill that mixes in a cereal with an ice cream base. If it sounds crazy it IS and you have to see it yourself! Since it was soft opening some items weren't available. I really enjoyed the fruity pebbles mix-in with ice cream we got. Not only aesthetically pleasing but had the right amount of sweetness. Only thing was off today my ice cream was melting too fast. Get your hands on that Hoji-cha latte! If your into roasted tea like me you'll like the smokey flavor. They also have matcha lattes for matcha lovers and drilled ice cream shakes. The decor is spot on for the gram. Cute tropical prints, yummy on-trend desserts and friendly staff! Thanks Dripps!",1
"Vegan friendly! Some of us can't eat regular ice cream as lactose bothers tummy. They offer lactose free ice cream and they are very good. Drinks they make here is so pretty, I originally found this place via Instagram as so many people posts yummy looking drinks online. Service is very good. Friendly and efficient. Now I learned their menu, if my lactose intolerance person wants ice cream, I know where to go.",1
"We stopped by on a Friday night 40 minutes before their closing time, and the line was still pretty long! The menu is up on the wall so we had enough time to look it over and see what we wanted. The decor is super cute inside, and the lighting is perfect for some great pictures! They do have limited seating and they have a few tables outside as well. We were lucky to find us a little corner to sit down at, as everything else was already occupied. It was dirty though and had ice cream all over. We ended up ordering one Thai tea with boba and a vanilla cone with fruity pebbles and sprinkles. Our total was close to about $12.. Yikes, a little too high in my opinion.... The cashier was beyond friendly and he got us through quickly! We sat down and waited for our treats. The ice cream was pretty good and it was very creamy. We enjoyed the Thai tea (it was nothing special) and the boba was perfectly made. It was the right amount of chewyyyyyy! *It can get pretty expensive especially if there are a lot of ppl in your group. We don't have that big of a sweet tooth, so we ended up sharing our ice cream cone between three people. I can't imagine how much it would've been if we had all ordered one... Do come though cause it's pretty neat inside and a bunch of their other drinks look really cool and tasty! I will be back again to try those out.",1
"We were in town for the Aloha Fest and as usual, I was craving something to satisfy my sweet tooth. So of course, I had to do to my search on Yelp and low and behold, it led me right here. What made this place even more enticing is the fact that it was just around the corner from where we were staying. Now what initially drew me to this place is the fact that they serve cereal infused ice cream. I thought ""that's different, let's give it a try."" They have many different cereals which includes many childhood favorites like Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisp, and Frosted Flakes. Trying to figure out our own mix was a bit overwelming so we all decided to go with something from their signature ice cream menu. The ice cream itself was creamy and definitely hit the spot. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered with the exception of the big teenager. He got the Cookies n Cream and wasn't too happy about it. He said it was too milky and didn't have enough ""cookie taste"" to it. But besides him, everyone else enjoyed their ice cream (me included). I went with the Thunder Buddies and the Teddy Grahams just gave a nice extra touch to it. But as many other yelpers stated previously, their creations are definitely instagram picture worthy, especially with their decorated wall. So make sure you take a minute or so and snap that picture.",1
"This place was delightful. Yet unexpected. I've never had cereal ice cream before, but this place is near my house and right by Pokitrition.... so I had to try it out. I let my 11yo order for both of us. We had a cinnamon toast crunch milkshake, and a cookie dough milk shake. I had no idea what to expect, and was very pleasantly surprised. Both were fantastic!!! A little on the pricey side, but worth it for an occasional treat. We'll be back for sure",1
"First time was tonight after dinner and the place was super cute!! Very simple and clean, such friendly staffs and great service! I ordered an ice cream swirl in a cup and it came out way better than I thought, the way it got mixed together with one choice of your mix, PERFECT Would come back again, they have my business! Next time I'll try out the beautiful drinks, it's nice how they used canvases with photos of their drinks as advertisement.",1
Perfect for the Arizona heat. Saw this place on social media and knew I wanted to try this place out when I visited. The specialty drill infused ice cream was a real treat and the you can't go wrong with the drinks here either. *Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Super nostalgic! Definitely an upgraded taste to the strawberry shortcake ice cream bars from my childhood. The strawberries and cream cheese taste mend together really well. The ice cream has hints of graham cracker and the flavors are well incorporated with one another. *Strawberry Matcha Latte Very pretty before mixing and letting the flavors get to know each other. The matcha flavor is really rich here and the strawberry jam adds a good amount of sweetness to the drink. *Rose Milk Latte I really liked this one since it had a mellow flavor. The rose hints blends nicely with the tea. The normal adjustments are just enough where the sweetness doesn't overpower all the other flavors.,1
"There's a saying now that we eat with our eyes and this place is a prime example of picture perfect dessert. Not only the dessert is well put together, the interior as well. Now there's a big trend going on with grassy walls with neon signs and there's one implemented here to show off your dessert! These places are definitely a reminder that we're slowly started to get all the ""Cali-like"" boba/ ice cream places. Phoenix is really needing more places like this and I'm very happy it's in a prime spot. They're located next to Pokitrition, near off the 101 and Ray. The cool thing is that the creators of Pokitrition also made this place too! I didn't get to try the boba just yet but the ice cream is great. While being one of the reasons I don't have a 6 pack yet, this just makes it worse cause I'd probably be craving this place. KITH Treats is also a place that I get reminded of about this concept. This place is going to blow up and be packed. I'll be back for more. CERTIFIED BANGER",1
Loved it super refreshing! For my strawberry matcha I would probably ask for it less sweet next time,1
"Very cute shop, extremely instagram friendly with the green plant wall and neon sign. Super cute decor and couches, everything was spotless! The menu was a little confusing. I decided to do the standard combination because I didn't know what to choose based on my own combo. They have a lot of cereal topping options and the consistency is great! It is much better than cold stone creamery. It's around $7 for a cone or milkshake. They also have boba and fresh matcha tea. I'll have to try that next time. The strawberry shortcake was definitely my favorite, they placed fresh slices of strawberry on the side with sprinkled cinnamon crunch on top. It was a good size, almost too big to finish. The cone tasted very good. Definitely worth checking out if you're interested in mix-in style ic cream",1
"My first time coming here and I like it! Little cute shop and they have cream infused ice cream serving premium matcha sourced straight from Japan featuring layered drinks plus boba, but optional. If you grew up and loved cereals and now you're tired eating cereals or simply because you don't have time to eat in the morning for breakfast and you have a favorite childhood cereals, this is the place to go! They have cereal shakes such as Fruity Pebbles, Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Oreos mixed together with super premium 16% butter fat ice cream and topped off with one of these choices like graham cracker crumbs, gummy bears, chocolate or caramel drizzle and teddy grahams. I ordered their brown sugar milk tea with boba and matcha latte. The price is right for the size, I wished they could put more matcha on my latte. The boba is a bit firm, but it works. Their other desserts look delicious too and I will come back to try their other yummy items in their menu.",1
"Lucky #777! Happy New Year! Let's start the new year off on a *sweet* and lucky 5-star note~! Rose Tea Fact: Rose tea has several beneficial effects including boosting the immune system, treating a sore throat, boosting your digestive health, and has high levels of antioxidants and vitamin C. So drink it! I've been seeing my girl Lien S. checking in here and I have been meaning to drop in for a while but I never seem to be in this area. And with the owners of Pokitrition being the mastermind behind Dripps, how could I not? And now that I've have their Rose Milk Latte, I'm hooked! Matcha Coffee, Hojicha Latte = Meh! Coconut Matcha, Sweet Matcha, Strawberry Matcha = Yes! Rose Milk Latte = Yaaas!!! I haven't tried much of their ice cream selection besides the Caramel Apple since it's cold both outside and in my heart but they look good. Dripps also offers a soy milk option for their drinks too so rejoice! I'll be back again and again for that Rose Milk Latte. Pea flower tea? Sign me up!",1
We went here for a drink after eating poke. I thought the matcha coffee was good. I like green tea and cold brew so makes sense. They have several other unique drinks I want to try,1
So busy... but worth it! DELICIOUS! The staff were so nice and gave everyone samples while they waited! Only recommendation... a bigger location!!!!,1
"I'm so glad there is another boba place to visit when I'm in Phoenix. I had ordered the iced matcha latte, which was perfectly made the way I like it (you can definitely taste the matcha, but it's not too overpowered by the sweetness of the sugar and milk). The cereal milk ice cream was also delicious. I almost forgot to take a picture, since it looked so good.",1
Thunder buddies was delicious! Ice cream had a great consistency and was not overly sweet. Would love to come back and try others when I'm in the area.,1
Very nice dessert spot. If I didnt live so far I'd be here once a week! The Butterfly Lemonade is EXCEPTIONAL!!!,1
"I had the strawberry shortcake cone and it was so good! It was also huge and I couldn't finish it. Their teas are also really good, and the staff is friendly. Very clean and cozy inside. Will definitely be coming back.",1
Very yummy new build your own cereal soft serve shop! They have so many different mix ins you can choose from (almost all of them Being ice cream) and also a bunch of different toppings. The staff was also very friendly and helpful to new customers. Interior design was so pretty and very bright making me want to stay and eat my soft serve there and hangout. Definitely coming back,1
"Local slow churned ice cream with the perfect amount of butter fat. Mix it with your favorite childhood cereal and this brings you back to childhood memories. This is a must try in Phoenix and perfect for any hot day to cool down. Once you try this, you'll want more.",1
"I visited Dripps with my husband. The decor was super cute and I liked that they had a wall for the Instagram pictures. One of the employees helped us out by explaining the menu and helping us pick our options. My husband ended up getting one of their signature ones, cookies and cream. I ended up making my own shake with fruity pebbles. I loved the variety and how I could make my ice cream the way I wanted.",1
"Sooo, I love icecream. But dripps has put two of my most favorite things together so I can enjoy cereal and soft serve! So creamy and crunchy! Glad they brought this icecream that is a must try! Friendly knowledgeable staff! Definitely worth the wait! Have already gone 3 times in a week!",1
Rewind is amazing! I had the green tea soft serve and the pink drink with crystal boba. Both were very tasty and I'd definitely recommend.,1
"I love the atmosphere of this place. They have plenty of natural lighting, good wifi, deskspace, and even a small sofa for lounging. This is a great spot for studying or bringing friends/kids to play board games. Definitely one of my new Chandler favorites!",1
"Killin it at Dripp's! LA Ktown native traveling south to AZ for vacation with family and who would've thought there would be a dessert gem in this desert! At first glance, the store looks really clean and decorated moderate and appropriate. Alot of cute areas for photo ops(IG Worthy), sit down, relax and study. Being a first timer, the staff there were super friendly when explaining their concept of blending ice cream and treats. Strawberry Shortcake: if Cold Stones was the ice cream mixing giant of the 2000's... Dripps is the ice cream mixing innovators of the future.. seriously. The ice cream was soft and creamy and the flavor profiles of the extra mix ins were delightedly recognizable yet worked well to compliment each other. I really enjoyed all the other extra candy toppings that i got to choose. This treat was just that: A TREAT! Also try the Thunder Buddies! My nephew got it and i loved how well the Reese's blended well with the ice cream! I will definitely be back for more on my next AZ trip, thanks for the awesome visit Dripps!",1
Came here for their grand opening. I think it went pretty smoothly! I got a mix in of the fruity pebbles with fruity pebbles topping in a drip cone. It was really good! And also a strawberry matcha latte. I was a little disappointed with the latte only cause I feel like I didn't get much of the strawberry purÃ©e. I love the concept though!,1
"Perfect matcha, perfect Thai Tea, perfectly cooked boba, lovely people working! First time we got the Rose tea and sweet matcha, second we got Thai tea and rose tea again perfect spot!",1
"Amazingly delicious ice cream, great service and yummy drinks with a great atmosphere and dont forget to take a pic of your stuff next to the drip it like it's hot sign! Best ice cream I've ever had without a doubt!",1
"Dripps Soft Opening is this week so we stopped by to try out their selection! Here's the vanilla soft serve with oreo mixed in, topped with pocky sticks. It's amazing how the infusion of their ingredients create a completely new experience. They served it in a delicious waffle cone decorated with a sweet drizzle. It felt like we were kids again eating ice cream on a hot summer day. I definitely recommend trying this spot out, they have a variety of mix-ins and add-ons for you to choose to your hearts desire. I'm excited to return again and test out more combinations!!",1
"Love the service and the ice cream! We also tried the drinks, the butterfly rose lemonade is so good!! Highly recommend",1
"This was an awesome experience, a little more than I'd like to spend on milkshakes but definitely a cool experience and I highly recommend doing it at least once, the staff was great the facilities were clean. I will say seating is limited so it can get crowded.",1
"Fun little shop, & friendly service. I've tried both the lychee & peach green tea, and mango black tea; both were delicious. FYI- The butterfly rose lemonade literally taste like a rose so if you're not a fan of your drinks tasting like a flower, then you may not like this one in particular. I cannot eat dairy so I have yet to try their dairy based drinks, however they did tell me that they can substitute with almond or coconut. I will be returning to try out more. :)",1
Delicious milkshakes. I had my reservations about a place using prepackaged cereal as a main ingredient in the majority of their dishes. But I was wrong. They. Are. Delicious. I also really enjoy watching the assembly process.,1
Loved it! Perfect for a late night treat! Highly recommend trying out their special shakes,1
"Went here a few weeks ago. We were there later in the evening and there was basically no line. My worldview was completely changed by fruity pebbles in my ice cream! We also got the Apple Jax milkshake...it was good, more of a large ice cream as opposed to a milkshake. Only reason for 4 stars was it took a while to get our order.",1
"We had the Thunder Buddies and the Minion's Treat. Substituted banana for cheesecake on the minion's treat. The treats were delicious, the ambience was modern and hip. I'll definitely be coming back. By far the best ice cream in this part of the valley. My only mild complaint is that I wish they were a little more diligent about wiping down the tables. Go here for instagram-worthy ice cream!",1
"This place is easy to get to, is clean and the staff are nice. I had the Matcha with Strawberry puree and it was so delicious. I thought it would be too sweet and not enough matcha but it was perfect! My friend got the pink crush and that was really good too! Will be back here again",1
"This place is super creative for having cereal-infused ice cream, and it was super delicious too! The shop environment was really Instagram-worthy and the people working were extremely friendly and I got my order within a few minutes. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for dessert that has different textures, perfect for summer!",1
"What friendly service! Walked in looking for a caffeine kick and was immediately greeted with a smile and info about what they served. Fun, little place with a hip atmosphere. Drink was hand delivered to me and oh my goodness....so delicious.",1
"Found this place thru an Arizona based foodie account. I am a matcha fanatic and I ordered the matcha ice cream. The quality is fantastic, but if the owner ever reads this- substitute the chocolate pocky sticks for matcha ones!",1
We love this place. They got great boba and you can also adjust the sugar level to your liking. Ice cream looks delicious might try it next time. But definitely recommend the Thai tea boba :),1
"Great ice cream I got the matcha tea I cream but two issues: #1 came a with chocolate pocky sticks instead of matcha. #2 greatly expensive, I bought 2 for $16. Definitely not a great deal. But at the end of the day they at least deserve 4 stars because I was impressed with the taste.",1
"My brother took us here & I gotta say..... one of the best boba places here in AZ. There's one closer to where we're staying for our summer vacay, but we drove out a little just for this place!",1
Best boba in AZ! So yummy and tapioca is always fresh and chewy! I recommend the brown sugar milk tea or the strawberry matcha latte! Both are so delicious!,1
Walking into dripps I instantly felt refreshed. The space is bright and vibrant. It's small but just big enough to seat a moderate amount of ice cream eaters. Dripps produces Instagram worthy treats that are catered to cereal addicts. But the don't only have cereal as a topping. You can easily choose from several different candy bars or melty drizzles. There is something for everyone. I ordered a milkshake. Not just any milk shake but a snickers crushed and infused melody of crunchy vanilla goodness. It was delish. My bf ordered a sundae with Capitain crunch and my mom ordered a surprisingly delicious vanilla cone chucked full of strawberry flavor and snicker dust on top (copy cat). We all enjoyed our treats and sat at a cute table near the window. This place gets busy pretty quick but the line seems to move rather quickly. I don't enjoy giving Reviews that are under 5 stars if I enjoyed my experience at a restaurant or establishment. In fact it's annoying to see someone give a rave review under a 4 star rating. *rolls eyes* I'm giving 4 stars because although I enjoyed my experience I was pretty shocked to see how small the ice cream cup was that my bf received. It literally looked like a kids serving. And that in itself costs $6. My milkshake was huge and the cone was huge. I looked around and saw others with larger servings as well. Maybe they messed up the order? Idk. I'll be back again but I don't suggest ordering a cup of ice cream. Get a milkshake or cone.,1
"I went here the other day with my sister and I was surprised by how unique the flavors were! The place itself was designed really nicely and they even offer an aesthetic backdrop for your boba drinks and ice cream. I got the matcha & strawberry with boba and it was so good, it was a little sweet so the next time I come back I'm probably going to have to lessen the sweetness, and my sister got a rose milk tea latte with boba, which was also surprisingly good. Not only were the drinks delicious, but the service was extremely good and the workers were very friendly! Overall, it's definitely a place worth checking out.",1
"I like this place due to great location, amazing nice employees, and interior wise is nice relaxed place. Good place to hang out.",1
This place is delicious! I love their cereal based soft serve. It is breakfast as desert and each bite turns me into a small child again. I have tried a few of their drinks and most have an ingredient I don't like such as matcha or Jasmin but my friends who are not against floral as a beverage love their drinks.,1
"I forgot to post my review on this spot a few weeks ago but wanted to go back to it since it was a fun place experience. Mostly really into the decor of this spot, if your looking to go somewhere cute and trendy for pics. But I also really liked their boba tea and they have some really unique options to choose from. I'll be back to try their ice cream soon...looked amazing too!",1
"My boyfriend and I tried this place and it was pretty good! You get to choose what kind of cereal or ingredients get blending into your ice cream or milkshake & then what cereal, candy or other toppings go on top! Good place to go if you're craving ice cream or just something sweet",1
First time here and won't be the last. Thank you to the friendly staff. The strawberry cheesecake was rich but not overly sweet. The graham crackers on the ice cream stayed crunchy till the last bite! Both of the matcha drinks were fantastic!,1
"I took my son and his bestie here for a quick treat. Really loved it. The drinks are as refreshing as they are pretty, and the staff is very friendly!",1
The rose milk latte was delicious and pretty to look at. The matcha coconut was refreshing without being too sweet the boba was chewy and fresh. Will go again. A little bit of a long wait but I think that is because they were cutting open a coconut. The ice cream looked delicious as well different options. Small menu but since each drink is hand crafted the taste is superb and doesn't need a big menu to compensate.,1
"Yum-mmy!!!! Me and my husband stopped in here and ordered ice cream. After we placed our orders we were chatting with the girl that took our order about the other items they make. I first off have to say that I absolutely LOVE matcha! It's a great natural source of caffeine as well as a rich source of antioxidants. She asked if we have heard of matcha, I simply said yes but definitely went into my matcha connoisseur mode. She pointed out photos of fresh drinks they make and some including matcha. She proceeds with telling us that they get their matcha directly shipped in from Japan! Which made me ecstatic!! Back to reviewing our order, I got the Strawberry Shortcake and my husband the Cookies & Cream which were both lovely to look at, delicious and super filling. We'll be back for sure for dessert but I'll be back asap to try their matcha drinks!",1
"Got the rose milk latte, which was delicious. I'm glad this place started serving boba! We got a small, I believe, for ~$5. Tables were sort of filthy, so we had to wipe them down ourselves before sitting, but I believe there was only one person working behind the counter at the time, and he was understandably very busy with orders by himself. The flavors are pretty unique, so I'd go again!",1
"My friend and I found this place on a whim, and we are so glad we stopped by. Many people come here for ice cream, but you have got to try the drinks as well. I love the Strawberry Matcha Latte, and all the coffee drinks.",1
"I visited the day after their grand opening and it was still super packed, but worth it for their soft serve with their cinnamon toast mixed in and cheesecake bites on top. I just wish there was more cheesecake bites on top. I also got their rose milk and was slightly disappointed because there just wasn't enough rose for me. However, I will definitely be back to try other drinks and to get more soft serve. The space could be considered small, but has a super photogenic leafy wall for photos. It was also super nice of them to continue their BOGO deal for the week a total steal!",1
Around the chandler area this evening and saw this on yelp. Saw that they had matcha and I LOVE matcha from back in Cali. The matcha coffee was perfect after a big meal. Please open one out in the west valley! We need more stuff like this!!,1
Love the vibe! Got the Jasmine Milk tea & loved it. Great choice of music. Will definitely come back.,1
I have been wanting to try this place for a few months and today I finally made it in. So happy I did. I had a small scoop of the matcha ice cream with fruity pebbles mixed in and it was DELICIOUS. I didn't get her name but the sweet young lady that helped me was very knowledgeable and suggested I get the matcha coffee. She was even kind enough to Google items that we were unsure had gluten in it. I really appreciated her assistance and I will definitely go back again! Oh yeah and I got two matcha coffees. One for the ride home to Sahuarita and one for tmrw morning.,1
This is very high quality and tastes super good! You can get super creative with the flavors and mix-ins. I'll be coming back many more times!,1
I work across the street and tried rewind for the first time today! I am in love with it. The girl in the front was the sweetest! I definitely will be going back!,1
Our first time here and we loved it! My husband had a plain vanilla on a waffle cone and I had Bourbon Caramel which was to die for delicious! Not too sweet and the ice cream was so creamy. The prices were so reasonable for such great quality. Both staff members were very friendly. We will be back!,1
"With all the hype over cereal mixed into ice cream at Dripps, my family had to give them a try. We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake cereal infused ice cream cone, a strawberry matcha latte & the rose milk latte. The Strawberry Shortcake was captain crunch cereal, cheesecake & strawberries mixed into vanilla ice cream and topped with graham crackers & strawberry sauce. The ice cream mix was good, sweeter with the cereal & add ins. The strawberry matcha latte had strawberry purÃ©e on the bottom, then milk layer and topped with matcha. The rose milk latte has rose syrup on the bottom, milk layer in the middle and topped with blue butterfly pea flower tea. Both drinks were good but similar to what other boba places are serving nowadays. I would recommend the cereal infused ice cream cone over the drinks because it is more unique in flavor.",1
"Omg!! You need this place in your life especially vegans!! Vegan ice cream was amazing, plus you get to add your own toppings! So so good always trying to do dairy free and I will definitely be here every other week. Soo good",1
"Delicious! Sometimes the wait is pretty long if there are a lot of people in line, but people in line means they have a great product!",1
"Delicious and unique ice cream/drinks. I don't think the ice cream is worth the seven bucks though UNLESS the person making it puts in the effort into make it aesthetically pleasing. Because come one, that's what most people go in there for. One visit my ice cream cone looked squashed and lopsided, the next it was tall and proud with strawberry syrup that I didn't receive on my first strawberry shortcake cone. I'd take an out of town person here to show that AZ does have some cool spots, but I wouldn't come here on the regular. *side note- no substitutions on the signature combos. This includes simply omitting a topping due to allergies.",1
I first came here during their grand opening when the line was so long that it snaked out of their store. I did not regret the wait at all as the their ice cream and boba did not disappoint. I ordered their rose milk tea both times I visited which is both visually pleasing and tastes really good! I also ordered their famous cereal ice cream both times I visited which even had my mom impressed who wasn't planning to eat any of the ice cream. The worker at the counter was very nice and gave our family good recommendations from the menu as well as samples. She tried her best to accommodate to our needs and our orders came out pretty fast. I plan to visit again soon! The atmosphere of the place as well as their location is nice as well.,1
Amazing milkshake and great service. I will definitely be back to this local place. This was my first time,1
"After seeing this place pop up on my yelp, I thought id give it a try since we were in the area. We went on a Sunday afternoon so there was no waiting and we were able to order right away. My husband ordered the Thai tea and I ordered the vanilla soft serve infused with fruity pebbles topped with circus animal cookies. You can order from one of their pre made menu or create your own. They offer a variety of ingredients you can infuse into your ice cream. The way the mix the ingredients into the ice cream makes it taste so good. I got mine in a cup so I can share with my little one or you can order your ice cream on a waffle cone. They also offer drinks & teas if you're not in the mood for some ice cream. Definitely come try this place out :)",1
AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! Such unique flavors that blew me away. Highly recommend! The workers are incredibly sweet and nice.,1
Manager reached out letting me know that the issue had been resolved so that it would not happen again. I've been back several times since and it has been great every time.,1
"This ice cream was so tasty. Cute, quaint little place, and very sweet cashier at the front. She was quick to make our order and it was a beautiful presentation. Love it for a quick treat.",1
Very cute location! Very aesthetic. They have ice cream and boba options. Seemed a little pricey for what the ice cream was - $6 for vanilla soft serve blended with a cereal and 1 topping. I had Cinnamon Toast Crunch with honey drizzle. It comes in a cup or cone at no additional cost.,1
"A very great ice cream place, the portion is hugeeeee! Love the different variety they give, mixed with numerous selections of cereals. The rose milk tea was pretty good, definitely would recommend for the ice cream lovers to come and try! Ice cream definitely tasted very balanced. Not too sweet not too bland!",1
Love Dripps! Such a unique concept to mix cereal in with the ice cream. Every flavor I have tried has been delicious. My favorite is the Reese Puffs mixed in with Butterfinger topping. Such a yummy treat!,1
"I was here over Christmas day, it was nice and quiet. The backdrop and neon lights is key to be deemed an IG destination as you do a quick photo sesh to make those likes and comments rain. I had the sweet matcha drink while my friends ordered the strawberry cheesecake soft serve and the rose milk tea. I was able to try their orders and I liked it all. I would definitely come back here.",1
Great environment and friendly staff. It was my first time here and they walked me through what I could do and then what their favorite was. Will deff be back again!,1
"I found this place on Instagram and was in awe. It was closer to my boyfriends house than it was mine so I took a screen shot of the name and knew when I went down there we'd have to try it. Yesterday we so happened to pass it on our way home. Although it was a gloomy raining cold day I said I HAVE TO TRY IT. I was impressed. I did mix in fruit loops and he even told me that was a bad idea, yet somehow couldn't keep his spoon out of my cup. It was absolutely phenomenal, and I love soft serve. This is better because you get to mix in what you want and the soft serve is very creamy and thicker than others I've had. Only downside is it's a bit pricey for (~$7) for a small (cup) of ice cream. Worth it and will go back!",1
"The best milk tea shop love that they have milk alternatives. Top Drinks in my opinion, Iced Matcha w coconut milk or Rose Milk tea w Almond milk",1
"I would have to say that I'm not a huge fan of their matcha drinks, but I did enjoy their Matcha Soft Serve. I think it might be because there was so much milk I couldn't really taste the matcha. But, I mentioned I did like the soft serve. It was incredibly rich in flavor and wasn't super sweet, which was perfect. I got it the chocolate dipped cone topped with gold flakes and chocolate shavings. And believe it or not, the chocolate complimented the matcha very well. The shop overall was super cute and aesthetic so it's definitely photogenic. It's quite close to my house so I'd probably come back if I had a sweet craving.",1
"My boyfriend and I wanted to check this place out for awhile now, but the location is so far from where we live. The inside of this place is so cute and clean, definitely insta worthy. What I ordered was a cone mixed in with cinnamon toast crunch, topped with cheesecake bites. Costed roughly around $6. I've read yelp reviews about ice cream being costly, but lemme tell ya, it was so much ice cream, I couldn't even reach the cone!! It was so good and my tummy was so happy, but full at the same time. This ice cream cone could definitely be shared with others. My boyfriend got a milk shake with apple jacks mixed in. They also topped the milkshake with the cereal as well. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, he finished the whole thing. We will definitely be back soon and can't wait to try their teas.",1
This place is extremely cute. Very aesthetic with a wall that I've seen a ton of people take pictures at. The ice cream is also great! A little overpriced for the cones but yummy nevertheless. The boba was also delicious (it was sweet and soft). Thai tea is my go-to and they can customize the sweetness levels.,1
"This place was having a bogo special, so I was definitely interested in checking it out. My friend and I got the rose milk tea and the presentation was nice. It was in three layers: pink, white, and baby blue. You can also get it with boba. You're encouraged to stir it so all of the layers will mix. It was really good! Lastly, this place has really nice wallpaper and a wall of leaves for a good Instagram moment. Next time I go, I will try the ice cream. It looks like everyone around me got an ice cream and seemed to enjoy it.",1
Awesome ice cream concept! They mix in your favorite breakfast cereal to vanilla ice cream to make new flavors. The texture is a little different but still overall a great dessert! I tried the caramel apple and it was amazing!! All the flavors blended really well and the cheesecake pieces were an awesome addition. I recommend going back to try every combination! I think I'll get the cinnamon toast crunch next!,1
"DRIPPS is my answered prayer and biggest blessing to the Chandler area this year. I'm not kidding when I say I come here at least once a week. When they first opened in September, it was even more than that, taking advantage of their soft opening and grand opening discount and BOGO. They are an awesome company, from the owners over at Pokitrition. The star here is CEREAL INFUSED SOFT SERVE. And no, it is not just some cereal just sprinkled into the ice cream. It is generous amounts of cereal of your choice literally DRILLED in and it is the best cereal ice cream in the world. I am a huge fan of Christina Tosi's Milkbar cereal ice cream, but Dripps takes it to a whole other level. I can assure you your favorite childhood cereal is among their choices. They do have signature creations you could choose from and mix and match toppings, but what I love to do is just choose a cereal and use the same cereal as topping. Their ""supporting actor"" I would say is their matcha drinks. If you love matcha, you will be in heaven. They use real QUALITY matcha. Great flavor, good caffeine kick without the jitters. Next favorite is the rose milk tea. It's not too ""flowery"" it is more milky which I love. Their milk teas are good as well. The only one negative thing is the boba balls are not as soft as I would love them to be but I enjoy milk teas without boba so they get a pass. The whole concept is just amazing and I'll shout it from the rooftops if I could. I LOVE DRIPPS!",1
Love this local spot and love its sister company pokitrition. I think it's amazing they have a coconut based ice cream that is just as delicious!,1
"I love Dripps, they have great customer service. The staff is friendly and helpful. The ice cream is amazing, the cereal is not soggy at all.",1
"More of these modern dessert places are popping up and it makes Arizona more fun! I got an ice cream cone that was ""infused"" with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and strawberries as a topping. I thought it was enjoyable, but there were some cereal parts that were oddly chewy, like they've gone stale. The place looks very comfortable and it has cute, modern decor that you can take pictures with. Either the marble table, the palm leave wallpaper, the grey walls, or the ""succulent"" wall that has a glowing sign which reads, ""Drip it like it's hot."" It's a cute place and it has some creative ice cream flavors. My cousin got a matcha drink and the matcha is very high grade, but we both thought it was very heavy on the matcha.",1
"I the ice cream , great Coustumer services ,clean place, LOVE LOVE There matcha te definitely coming back , friendly environment .",1
I have been to this place a few times. They have ice cream infused with cereal or milk tea drinks. The cereal-infused ice cream is a pretty neat concept. I don't think I have been to another dessert shop that does this. They definitely give you a lot of toppings. This is a great place for meeting up with friends after a meal and we just want something light to snack on and catch up. The drinks in my opinion weren't as great as other places. I ordered the jasmine milk tea which was a little light compared to other boba shops. However I really love matcha and will have to try their matcha drinks next time.,1
"Tatum walks up before we leave and says ""you have the best ice cream!"" Yummy and unique. Def going back and coming from Scottsdale, I must say it's worth the drive. Get it!!! Greg #myfitmortgage",1
"I recently moved to the area, and as a passionate foodie, was looking for a new boba/ice cream shop to feed my cravings! Search no further! The decor is beautiful, and the staff were friendly; they gave some recommendations of their popular drinks, and they also do seasonal ones too! I decided to go with the Rose Milk Tea which has hints of floral notes; absolutely refreshing and not too sweet. My friend created his own ice cream with toppings, but don't worry, they've got popular creations of their own if you can't make up your mind. Overall, a great quality dessert place, and I will definitely be back!",1
"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday around 3pm and we expected a long line of people. To our surprise, it was just us and 2 other people. The inside was clean and well kept except for the couch they have. We figured a lot of people like to sit on that couch so there's some ice cream stains on it. It was our first time here and the menu is very self explanatory so it's easy to order what you want. The service was great, we enjoyed our ice cream and milkshake. Would definitely recommend to a friend!",1
Great menu with a great selection! I ordered ice cream and a rose milk latte and both were phenomenal! Staff were super nice and helpful! The orders came out so fast,1
Best Boba I've ever had. I'm a hardcore Boba fanatic. Really surprised as to the price. Wouldn't mind paying $2 more per cup to be honest.,1
My sister found this place on yelp and it looked like an awesome place to check out.OMG was I right!!They greeted us as we entered including anyone who entered and lemme tell ya this place got rather busy quick even though when we walked in there was only a couple people before us!Now I can see why! So many options regarding topping wise and mix in I loved it and the fact that they had all kinds of cereal options for you the mix in was amazing.I ended up getting a mix in swirl which consisted of a vanilla base ice cream and my choice of mix was lucky charms which they grinder into the ice cream yes!And I got a choice topping as well and I went with the marshmallow charms omg SOOOO GOOD! My sis ended up getting a matcha milk tea of some sort with boba! Hands down best ice cream place I've been to so far! Most def a place to go and check out if you're in the mood for some ice cream or drinks!,1
"Absolutely amazing. Flavor combos are unreal ... if you like classic cereals, you have to visit this place!!",1
"This place is soo good super cute, highly recommend the Cookie Crisp ice cream. It was very cheap as well which I was surprised. I will definitely be back to try different flavors :-)",1
SO GOOD!!! Been here 3 times already and love it. Wasn't sure if ice cream and cereal would be a great combo but it is excellent! Never had an issue with staff or service even when they are busy. Will definitely be back :),1
This place is BOMB! My husband and I LOVE all their milkshakes. Definitely has turned into one of our go to sweets joint. Perfection!,1
Super cool place. So many dairy free options and a very nice staff! I would highly recommend it!,1
Wow! Came in not expecting much else besides ice cream but they add cereal into it and it makes a WORLD of a difference. My order: strawberry shortcake Reminds me of the ice cream bar back in the day! Definitely coming back to try all the other signatures!,1
"I looooOVe the matcha and thai tea with boba here!! The texture of the boba is always perfect. The fruity pebble infused ice cream is my fav for ice cream! Love the cute instagram-able and family friendly interior, and customer service is always so awesome!",1
Just had the strawberry short cake ice cream and my wife had the one with bananas and teddy graham crackers and both were really good! Thanks to Keith for recommending this place that his friend owns!,1
YUMMM!!!! I can't wait to try all of the different flavors! This place is a must try!,1
"Came here for the first time and ordered the butterfly rose lemonade, it's really good. I'll come back again!",1
"Very instagram-able interior, and the menu is easy to understand. I looove cereal but this takes it to a whole new level! My favorite is the Cap'n Crunch milkshake.",1
"The ice cream is good and plentiful. The mix concept is different and the mixer is kinda cool to watch. The teas were decent and definitely pretty. Overall, it's a good spot and if I'm in the area again, I'd get an ice cream and a Tea to go.",1
"Rose milk latte! It taste delicious, must try! We got there on the second day after grand opening and they were so kind to give us a discount as we missed their grand opening day :)",1
"Such a unique concept, yet so simple. Cereal infused ice cream. My mouth is watering just thinking about how good this ice cream is. They even have a dairy free option which my daughter took advantage of. Would definitely recommend this joint to everyone and plan to go back in the near future.",1
It was the best ice-cream. My daughter loved it as well. We will be back soon. Don't forget to order macha coco together with your ice-cream. It was perfect match.,1
"Excellent, fresh ice cream with many eclectic toppings (and a drill to make room for them in the ice cream!) make Dripps a great place to go for dessert or a tasty treat. The iced Matcha green tea latte is absolutely delicious and a great way to get some antioxidants. Took one star off for the smaller space and time to wait for order. Otherwise, the food, drinks & service is top notch!",1
Love this place! We come here on the regular. Their ice cream is delicious (strawberry shortcake is my fave) and their jasmine milk tea is pretty good too. A HUGE plus that they also have a non-dairy option.,1
Very good ice cream and friendly management. Great place. They were very helpful in getting thing together to celebrate our grandson's birthday. Had a great time!,1
"Wonderful new addition to the area. I thought it would be just another ice cream place, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn differently. This was my first experience with Matcha. The employees have answered all my questions and take excellent care of me. I feel welcome each time I come in with a hello and focused attention. Definitely a new favorite of mine!",1
DRIPPS is amazing because they infuse cereal (nostalgia) to my ice cream! Huge favorite: Reese's Puff milkshake every-time!!!! But this month I had to get the pumpkin milkshake!!!!,1
I have been searching for a great Matcha Latte. I have been to many places and have yet to find a shop that takes the proper steps and uses the proper tools when preparing a matcha drink. I can happily end my search and say I found my favorite place because Dripps makes the greatest drinks!! I love the Strawberry Matcha Latte.,1
Worth all the hype. I got vanilla ice cream with Fruity pebbles infused with cheese cake bites on top and i couldn't stop eating it. Little bit of a drive for me from my house but it was worth it. Hopefully they open a location closer. 10/10 would recommend going.,1
"It is very rare for me to like something for a long period of time, I move on too quick you could say, but ice cream has always been my go-to dessert. Like many people, I'm especially a fan of ice cream that includes surprises inside like cookies and cream, rocky road, pistachio, ect. You can imagine my excitement when I heard that there was an establishment that created custom cereal/ice cream mixtures. Although feeling skeptical at first, as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by young cheerful workers and soothing lo-fi music (with an occasional pop hit here and there). The wall facing customers when they enter the store is decorated with leaves and lit up neon lights that spell ""Dripp it like it's hot,"" an original idea that adds a classy ambience to the shop (also perfect for taking pictures). The store isn't very big, but the furnishings are strategically placed to make it feel roomy and it also gives customers the option to enjoy their ice cream sitting on stools, padded chairs, a patio, or even a couch. The oddly satisfying thing about this establishment is that the temperature inside isn't so cold to the point where you feel rushed to leave; a quality that is hard to find with many other ice cream shops in the area. If you tend to have a hard time making decisions when presented with a bunch of choices, then you'll be relieved to hear that there are six ""signature"" options which feature the most popular mixes so that you don't end up making a bad mix. ""Thunder buddies"" is my personal favorite which features Reeses puffs, bananas, almonds, and teddy bear graham crackers. Truthfully, I thought that the ice cream wouldn't be much different from that of Cold Stone or any other ice cream competitor, but the cereal gave the ice cream a crunch that can be best described by my significant other as ""heavenly."" They also gave the ice cream to me exactly as it had appeared on the menu (we could see the workers placing the teddy bear crackers on their feet in the ice cream). While I've never been a fan of chocolate covered cones, people have the option to have their cone dipped in blue or pink chocolate (or both) for an extra dollar. I found it funny at first, but they also have an option to buy a bowl of any of the cereal options for $4.50. Even though that may seem like an unfair price for a bowl of cereal, it makes sense when you realize how desperate someone would have to be to pay $4.50 for a bowl of cereal when they could get a whole box for $3.00. The ice cream cones and milkshakes, however, are a bit more on the pricey side and cost me $5.95 before tax. Keeping the bowls of cereal in mind, you could just go to a supermarket and buy a whole tub of ice cream for the same price BUT you wouldn't easily be able to make a cereal-ice cream as fresh and crunchy as what Dipps gives you. For the experience, quality, and price I would recommend this place for most occasions including dates, family outings, and especially on cheat day!",1
Got ice cream infused with honey bunches of oats cereal with banana and pocky sticks. Was delicious and the workers were nice and efficient!,1
I came across this after eating some poke at the same plaza. The brightness and the decor caught my eye. After looking at their simple menu I understood their concept. I chose fruity pebbles for the milkshake mix in and that nostalgia hit me. Oh those kids memories! The milkshake was flavorful and soft. I had a sample of their matcha late and it was on point: not too sweet and strong matcha taste. The thing that bothered me was that the place was packed and I had to share the table with another party.,1
this place is so cute :') their cereal ice cream mixes are so creative and i love the interior of the place! the yellow neon sign on the green hedge wall is a great place to take pics with friends,1
This place is amazing! Great customer service and delicious ice cream and teas. I drove from mesa to try this place out and it definitely fulfilled my prego cravings. Would recommend this place to everyone!,1
"I tried Dripps for a second time today and I was really impressed by the drink I got. The owner recommended a matcha coffee (I'm usually not a fan of matcha or coffee) and it was surprisingly so good. I'll never drink coffee straight but I took a sip of the coffee before I stirred the drink and I could probably have a whole glass of that cold brew. Considering I was the only order, I think it did take some time. They seemed to crush the matcha powder (or something time consuming) fresh and put it in which is nice to see it be fresh but it took a few minutes for a simple matcha coffee being the only order there. I will be back for another. Thanks",1
"This place is so dope! Their ice cream creations are insanely good, and their drinks are amazing. I had a rose boba tea here and the flavor explodes in your mouth. So dang good. Can't wait to try more stuff. Their staff is always friendly, the ambiance is pretty cool too. Everyone needs to try this place out ASAP!",1
"Great customer service, relaxing environment & delicious desserts! Definitely would recommend this place and coming back again!",1
"I came in today with two other people. There were no other customers present waiting, so we didn't have to wait terribly long. We immediately appreciated the interior design. The two women in the back came out and greeted us and took our order. I ordered a brown sugar milk tea, one of the people with me ordered jasmine milk tea, and the other person with me ordered a chocolate chip cookie dough milk shake. The person with me did not like their jasmine milk tea, but the other person with me loved their chocolate chip cookie dough shake. I enjoyed the milk tea and felt it had the proper sweetness, nothing too overpowering. I ordered a pink rose milk tea. I loved the floral flavor, but felt the sweetness should have been toned down a little bit. The other person with me whom ordered a jasmine milk tea ordered a Thai iced tea. They said that it was better than a lot of the restaurants we previously ordered Thai tea from. The woman who took my second round of orders encouraged us to try the soft serve the next time we visited and recommended the strawberry shortcake. We will definitely be returning and I look forward to trying the strawberry shortcake.",1
I loved their ice cream cereal and their Rose Tea Lemonade! It was nice to feel greeted when walking in. Justin explained the menu really well and gave me his recommendations. I went with the Thunder Buddies and it was so creamy and tasty. The wait was a good ten minutes though but it was worth it. I'll be back soon!,1
One of my favorite new ice cream spots. The quality of the ice cream is great and the different combos they have are amazing. The team there is so friendly!!!,1
Cute little place. Mainly ice cream mixtures instead boba or drinks. Nice for the summer hangout! Very casual laidback place.,1
"Friendly faces greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked in. The lady behind the register was informative and genuine(wish I would have got her name). She explained everything to us and told us how it worked. Yummy ice cream. I had Reese's puffs ice cream with brownies and bills wafers, YUMM! My boyfriend tried their strawberry shortcake creation, both of us were satisfied. I would recommend this place to family & friends!",1
"Stopped by Dripps because it was conveniently located near Chandler mall and I've heard many good things about this place. I had their strawberry shortcake ice cream. Super impressed! The ice cream was creamy with the right amount of cereal mixed in to give some crunchiness. The staff was great and the place itself was simple, cute, and clean. Next time, I want to try one of their drink options (they have so many!). Highly recommend visiting!",1
Im a big fan of matcha and this tasted up to par with my last Japan's trip. I could taste the matcha well on the iced matcha latte. I tried their matcha coffee and it was really interesting and good. Im not really a coffee person but i still enjoyed it. I havent tried their ice cream yet but it looked so pretty i might try it next time. Parking lot was full on a saturday night so that was annoying.,1
"I'm Asian and I am lactose. I'm glad there's a vegan option for my tummy. I am in love with ice cream again. For their drinks they also have dairy alternatives, I choose the almond milk with my matcha latte. They are busy in the weeknights and the lines are sometimes long but I think it's worth it. Last time I came they didn't have a high chair for my niece so I suggested them to have one. Hopefully they take my comment into account.",1
"This is a fun place. I like that it tries to be different by having the cereal mix ins. It sets it a parts from other ice cream places. It is cute inside and has cute instagram shots. It is a little on the pricey side, so that is why I knocked it down to 4 stars. However, good quality and fun place.",1
Favorite ice cream place in chandler and only ice cream place I go. Delicious milkshakes and I get the fruity pebbles milkshake with granola on top 100% recommended,1
What a fun new idea. It reminds me a lot of Milk in NYC. The ice cream is really Fluffy and enjoyable and has a really nice taste no matter the mix in you get. We got the lucky charms and really enjoyed it! I'll be coming here again for sure. It's my favorite place to get ice cream in Phoenix at the moment.,1
Lived up to my expectations after watching Cake Boss all those years. Went back three times during our visit! Definitely recommend finding and their Restaurant across the way is awesome too!,1
"Last time I visited this place was in 2015, and I had a cannoli and hot chocolate after the Rock n Roll Las Vegas half marathon! This time, I got a slice of the strawberry frosting rainbow cake, and UGH. This is what an excellent frosting-to-cake ratio looks like! It's a large slice, so it makes an extra special treat when you want something sweet. I gave four stars because I think the packaging could be nicer (shift from plastic to paper/cardboard).",1
Highly recommend My mother ordered a slice of confetti cake from here and it was delicious!! What a way to celebrate 50th with a slice of something so delicious! Date of visit 3/6/22,1
"Date of visit: 4/11/22 Having snagged a piece of rainbow cake from one of the ubiquitous vending machines found on the Strip (seriously, they are almost as plentiful as Starbucks here!), my love and I decided to grab a piece from the source, Carlo's Bake Shop located in the Palazzo. Expect a wait to place your order, this place is pretty much always busy. I will say that I don't love the setup for the line, it's hard to see what you want to order without feeling like you're holding up the line for everyone else. I do wish there was a way to better scope out what they have before it's time to order, I feel that would improve the flow of traffic as well. Staff was friendly and the cake was fantastic, it even kept for over a day as we had bites here and there in the hotel room as to not gorge ourselves completely! I would certainly come back and try some other things the next time we are here, or even just get another slice of this cake!",1
"Wanted an afternoon pick me up and grabbed a lobster tail and a cannoli. The lobster tail filling was INCREDIBLE. Super rich, creamy, and not too sweet. The lobster tail was also FULL of the french pastry cream- they definitely didn't skimp here. The pastry shell was a bit on the harder side and a bit bland in taste, but the powdered sugar kept it lightly sweet and it was overall a good contrast to the cream in my opinion. The cannoli is HUGE and absolutely full of the ricotta cream. I didn't love that the shell didn't seem super fresh but the filling was pretty good. Both pastries were on the pricier side at $6.25 for the lobster tail and $5.50 for the cannoli, but would come back for the lobster tail!",1
"Was totally stoked to try this place as I haven't had the chance to go to the NJ original location. I got 2 different pastries - the regular cannoli and the regular ""lobster tail"". Very creamy and delicious.",1
"We waited in line twice here while staying at the Palazzo. We tried some cookies, cupcakes, and cannoli. My favorite was the chocolate dipped cannoli. The lines are long but they move you through pretty quick.",1
"I absolutely loved Carlo's Bakery!!! It took me over an hour to find it, but it was so worth it! The line was super long but their goods were to die for Next time I'm in Vegas, this will be my first & last stop!! (I got so much more than this)",1
"Best cannoli I've ever eaten, but very pricey! We got 3 original cannoli and a traditional lobster tail and it totaled $23 seriously? $5 a pastry is pretty steep but like I said the cannoli was the best My husband and I have ever had and we will definitely come back for more cannoli next time we're in Vegas",1
The best cannolis hands-down ever! The much-anticipated Savory delicious lobster tail cannoli was to die for. I would go there every day but I got to watch my waistline. It's a little bit on the expensive side $5 per cannoli but it's on Las Vegas Boulevard what do you expect...,1
First of all I want to thank Crystal for her wonderful service and beautiful smile thank you very much now as far as the desert unbelievably good the seats are extremely comfortable and the drinks are delicious we have a beautiful view of the street you can't ask for anything else please come on in and check this place out,1
"There was no line it was perfect and went fast. I got the Carmel lobster claw and it was delicious, it was stuffed full of Carmel custard. My friend got the sugar sprinkle cookie was bland and not buttery. The chocolate dipped cannoli was amazing. The hazelnut creampuff was ok it was messy and the hard chocolate on top made it difficult to get a good non messy bite.",1
"If you're a fan of Cake Boss on TLC you should know the name of this famous bakery shop . its located in side the Venetian Hotel. There always the long line , if you do not wait there is an option order online and pick up within 30 mins. Lobster tail pastry is a must try , this original ancestor of the lobster tail was called La Santarosa. The structure of it obviously resembles the architecture of a lobster's tail, as its shell is made of layered and crusty baked pastry, interlocking in the way that the parts of a lobster's tail does. How wonderful!!",1
"The cannoli's and the lobster tail were amazing! I was really hesitant after reading all the reviews online. But my husband said to give it a try anyway and good thing I listened! Oh and their brownie!!! O M G! It was amazing! I'm not the chocolate fan, my husband is. He had me try it and it was so moist and it just made my mouth water! Their customer service was good. We were greeted and helped right away! I'd recommend others to go and try it out for themselves!",1
"They didn't have lobster tails :( womp womp womp. My little brother & I are huge fans of the show therefore trying this bake shop was a must! I ordered 2 cheesecakes, brownie. Cookie, 2 cupcakes some crumb cake my total was $40 not bad. They didn't taste out of this world but I enjoyed every pastry! Line wasn't bad @ all and I will be returning :)",1
"I went in the morning and there was only one customer in front of me and the 2 ladies helping the front of the store were very nice and quick! The pastries, were amazing!! I tried the eclair, cream puff, canolis (obviously), tiramisu and the chocolate mousse tart! All were great! They did charge me for one tart that didn't end up in my box, but accidents happen! Would definitely go there again!!",1
Got the cookies and cream cake slice and it was pretty good... I think it would've tasted better a bit chilled or something and the prices are outrageous for just a slice of cake it was $9...,1
"Lots of mention of lines in previous reviews but there were only a few people there when I went. It was midday, midweek. I got two linzers and a cannoli. I haven't tried the linzer yet but the cannoli, wow! Best I've had in years. Might even give nonna a run for her money (shhhhhh).",1
Chocolate lobster tail is a must!! We are going back for more to bring home with us!!,1
"I was thrilled to visit this bakery, I was not thrilled to make that 30 minute line. The choices are so limited!! Nothing like the Hoboken original bakery shown on tv. The canolis not so good I guess since we went late they were probably there for hours. The reason I gave it 4 stars regardless the bad stuff the lobster tail was amazing!!!!!! It was big, tasty and great prize! I am now looking forward to go to the one in Hoboken in December!",1
"I got a couple cookies, not much appealed to me there in my opinion. There was so many people here. it was busy. Took about 20 minutes just to get a couple cookies and a mug. Lots of people watch the show I guess! There was alot of different baked goods, and it was not too pricey. The pricey items were the variety of gift box cookies, which are small, not worth it in my opinion.",1
Everything was perfect I wish there was one closer! Soooo yummy! Please come to Longview Texas!!,1
Visited the bakery and tried the famous lobster tail. It was delicious and I was bummed I didn't buy more. It was one of the best baked goods I have ever had! Also purchased a Carlos Bakery mug and love using it for my morning coffee! I didn't buy as much as I hoped here and completely regret it now. I can't wait to visit Vegas again and come back to the bakery! Next time I definitely want to try the restaurant too!!,1
Great place to grab a snack and some coffee. The lines appear long at times but really only take about 5 minutes to get through. The day I went they had a special that provided you a free Carlos water bottle with 24.00 purchase. Nice souvenir if you're from out of town.,1
"Omg omg omg!! I came here 4 years ago to relish on the famous traditional Canoli and Lobster tail.. I came back today reminiscing the day I was here last time. Beautiful place, great staff, quick service.. a place I would recommend all to definitely try and not to forget the traditional Canoli and Lobster tail. You can't come here and not try one of these!",1
Best cannolis ever. Must get them. They are so awesome. I love the creme. Its not too sweet. I always try to make a stop whenever Im in vegas.,1
"My family and I have tried many of their bakery items. In my opinion, stay away from the floured cakes, cupcakes (dry as a bone, better cupcakes at walmart) cookies and donuts. Go for the italian and any of the custard filled pastries, such as the Lobster tail and Napoleons with the powdered sugar and the cannolis... Cheesecakes are OK. Also anything with whip cream. Those are the pastires where they shine. They discontinued one of the items I like, the cannoli cake tower... Maybe I was the only one buying it? Overall, this place satisfies our longing for the italian baked goods in NYC Little Italy, where we all moved from.... such as, Ferrara's. Has been hard to find decent italian pastries out here in the west coast. This one comes close. Have never been to the Carlo's in NYC because I never heard of it. Maybe it didn't exist back then. But it would be hard to beat the italian bakeries in my neighborhood.",1
"The bakery is across from Buddy's large restaurant that has a great view of the strip. The bakery is a little small, but the cannolis and lobster tail were very good. Not too sweet, just how I like my desserts. The lobster tail tasted like a cream puff but even better. I didn't get to try an actual cake, but they looked just as good. Tasted better than some desserts I tried at Bacchanal at Caesar's!",1
"So, my friend wanted to stop by this bakery before heading back home to get some goodies. I bought a couple cannoli's and a ""lobster tail."" I can't say anything wrong about the cannoli, because it was delicious, but i personally thought that the ""lobster roll"" wasn't one of the best pastries i ever had. I bought my daughter a heart shaped cookie as well, and she ate that thing pretty quick.. lol.",1
"I have cake boss recording on DVR and I watch it all the time. I didn't even know he had a shop in Las Vegas until I saw a banner. I knew I had to stop by because I am a fan !! Obviously this isn't the original shop in Hoboken but I always wanted to try the pastries they talk about on the show. Lobster tails are the ones that they claim to be the most popular and boy did they look good so I was super excited to try one. The line on Monday morning at around five in the afternoon was short and the wait was not long at all. We decided to try the mini dark chocolate mousse cake, red velvet mini cake, tiramisu, and lobster tail. All the mini cakes were around $10 while lobster tail around $6. The employees were friendly and knowledgable Everything tastes wonderful. Don't know if the prices are the same in Hoboken but it is Vegas here so price is whatever. I'm just so happy I had something to hold me over until I can visit his shoe in New Jersey one day :)",1
depending on the time frame that you arrive the wait is ridiculous. I am grateful however that I was able to experience the flavor of some of the sweet treats.Enjoyed the ability to watch the workers produce these sweet treats.,1
"Well, we stayed in line for 1 hour and 10 minutes... was it worth it... hmmmm.... I would say yes... but, if you truly have some time to kill in Vegas... or really need to stay in one place not to make a full of yourself walking drunk all over the Vegas strip. Definitely delicious! The famous ""Lobster Tail"" pastry is worth the wait. But if you are going to stay that long in that line, load up on them! Other items on the menu are just like in many other bakeries... but with better presentation. To help you stay sane while standing in line, you have a chance to see how a professional cake decorator puts together some of the cakes that you see on the shelves as you enter the bakery. Quite fun... even if you are an adult.. even more fun if you have already had a few (or a dozen) cocktails before getting to the bakery... (just make sure you are not drooling all over the window)...",1
"I first heard of Carlo's Bake Shop from browsing around YouTube and discovering TLC's series, Cake Boss. After finding out that they had a location in Vegas (and I was heading out to Vegas in a few weeks), I was looking forward to trying out their TV-featured pastries. I had high hopes, just like every viewer, and expected to be bedazzled. I mean, this guy can make the most outrageously extravagant cakes ever. I expected the best of the best, but was left feeling kind of disappointed. Pros: -Conveniently located inside The Venetian Hotel. Also right across from his restaurant, Buddy V's Ristorante (which is also average). -All their desserts are not too sweet. The red velvet cake, which can be too sweet sometimes, wasn't too sweet at all! -The cannoli and the napoleon cake is pretty good! -They provide free paper plates, knives, and forks if you ask! -Desserts are simple and plain. but pretty GOOD. Cons: -The wait. Prepare to wait for an hour. Since it's a tourist attraction, they have a long line that expands way past the store. -The service. The reason why the wait is so long (even though they serve everything ALREADY made) is because the servers work at a very slow and calm pace. I'm from a big city, so I'm use to quick service, but they REALLY take their time here and the wait is already long enough. =( Also, once you order your pastries, you wait in a separate line to pay. And there is only ONE cashier. Since Carlo's is such a popular spot, I wonder why they won't hire more workers and have more cash registers? -The buttercream filling. They use the same filling for their cream puffs and eclairs. Maybe if they used a different filling to complement each pastry, it would be more unique. I didn't really like it. It tasted mostly like butter. Nothing rich, flavorful, or unique. -Didn't see the crazy cakes on the show. I saw some nice cakes that they hang on the wall, but nothing too crazy. -You don't actually see them making the desserts in the window. They bake in the kitchen which you can't see. The window where you do see them, they're simply transferring desserts around. Nothing exciting. -The quality/taste of the desserts. Solid good desserts overall. But not unique or memorable. Some are very plain. I'll still come back since I want to try the famous lobster tail, but the ridiculously long wait and slow service also makes me want to avoid this place like the plague. :/",1
Super small bakery but they serve delicious chocolate cannolis & their coffee is great too! We will definitely be back in the future to try some more pastries!,1
"Had the lobster tail. Not bad, but the filling is a custard instead of ricotta cheese like a sfogliatelle. The cafe mocha was not bad either. I went early in the morning to avoid the crowds.",1
"When we got here there was a line (it was a Sunday afternoon) and it took about 20-30 minutes for us to place our order. We got a salted caramel lobster tail and a red velvet cupcake. The salted caramel lobster tail was great. The red velvet cupcake was okay, I like the red velvet cupcake at Georgetown Cupcake more. But I would go back for the lobster tail! Very limited seating at the bakery.",1
"Lots of choices....get there early as the lines are very long. The ""lobster tails"" are really good. EVERYTHING is good!! I have heard the crumbcake is awesome..however, they sell out of that rather quickly. I will definetly be back....(see picture)",1
"I was stopping over at Vegas for a day, and found out Buddy has a store here. So wanted to check it out. Had the cannoli and lobster tails, they were both made to perfection.....love it!!! However, the service is just ok, a bit slow, now I understand why the lines are so long.",1
"I'm so happy with my experience this afternoon I went in not really sure what I wanted and tbh kinda stressed because I really needed a cake, so thankful Noah was so patient and kind to my mom and I even when we were all over the place and couldn't make up our minds ( so much to choose from & all look so yummy) so so so in love with our cake and decorations even though it was so last minute you guys made me one happy gal. Noah and jasmine are amazing!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!",1
"The line was long to get in this place and it surely did not disappoint. We picked up mini chocolate mouse cake, red velvet cupcake, cannoli, lobster tail and some kind of cookie bar. Everything was awesome and so fresh! This place is a must try when you're in Vegas!",1
"We've always been a fan of the show Cake Boss, so when we heard there was a bakery shop in the Venetian we made it a point to check it out! My sister ordered a maple donut cannoli and let's just say, there was no need to wrap it in a box to take to go. After 1 bite, she couldn't put it down. These bakers are TALENTED and the treats are quite the treat!",1
"Carlo's Bakery has only been open a few days and obviously it's getting a lot of attention! We came by on a Thursday night just a little before 10pm, hoping we'd miss the rush. While it wasn't too bad, we still ended up being here for about 45 minutes from start to finish. It's located directly across from Buddy V's and it is a pretty small location. The kitchen takes up most of their space there but has windows on both sides for you to watch them do their magic while you wait. Inside, you'll see a few display cases and the walls covered with merchandise and some custom cake examples. During our trip, we were instructed to grab a number and hang out until it was called. There was no actual line. We ordered lobster tails, cheesecake, a cannoli and some other small treats. The prices aren't out of this world and with all the stuff we got, we only ended up spending about $35. The cannoli was great and had a nice shell that wasn't overly hard like you find a lot of times. My favorite of all so far though, is the lobster tail though. Trust me when I say, they are addiction! It's a light, cream filled pastry that has an unexpected crunchy exterior. At just under $6, the lobster tail is a must try! For a celebrity location, it definitely exceeded my expectations. You most likely aren't going to find the most amazing thing you ever tasted in your life here but it's well worth the visit. The staff is also extremely friendly and tentative. Plus, if you're anything like me, you'll have tons of fun watching them use that automatic box wrapper over and over again...",1
"You saw the show, now eat your cake too! A wide variety of pastries made on site. Don't forget to take a number!",1
"I love this place! It's the one bakery on the strip where nothing was too sweet. The wait can be a bit hectic depending on the time of day and the staff will surely mess up your order, but if it's sweet, I'll eat it. I did not detect any artificial flavors here and everything tasted fresh. Came here around noon on 5/9/14 to get my tickets to Buddy's Vegas Uncork'd event, which was awesome btw. Line wasn't too bad, I waited maybe 20 minutes. Staff is young and can be unprofessional... something you would attribute to new college students or graduating high school students. They weren't rude, but it'd be nice to get my order right. Lobster tail - remained crispy for two days! Filling is decadent but not heavy, not too sweet, and absolutely delicious. Cannoli - shell is lightly spiced complementing the ricotta filling. This will soften if you leave it overnight, so eat it soon (like you will have any trouble eating it right away). Rainbow cookies - moist and dense just like I like it. Not too sweet as is often the case with this type of cookie. Cream puff - this was okay, I like the asian cream puffs more. Hazelnut Biscottis - These were perfectly sized, crunchy, and heavy on the hazelnut flavor and nuts. I really liked these and will probably buy a big bag to take home next time. Vanilla hazelnut meringue cookie - strong hazelnut flavor and fun to eat! These were generous with the hazelnuts and definitely crunchy. It satisfies when I need a crunch. Wedding cookies - typical pecan butter cookies, nothing special, but good. Chocolate hazelnut tart - I think I wished it had more nutella flavor, but it was good nonetheless. It was light on the hazelnut aroma. Red velvet cake - this comes with cream cheese frosting filling. It's stronger on the cream cheese flavor and I prefer the roux buttercream with red velvet. The cake was very moist and light, I killed it. Star item: GET THE LOBSTER TAIL! You can even get some to take home as they remain crispy for awhile... at least in the dry dessert heat anyway.",1
"My wife would say ""this is delicious and we better than she imagined it could be"". Long line, brief wait, but way worth it. We got the lobster tails and they are the best I've ever had. The price was a little more than anticipated however that's just because I didn't even know how much it would cost. Flavor wise it was worth it. You did good, Buddy. You did good.",1
I easily spent $53 on 11 items 2 cheesecakes (mini) 7 Cannoli's (small) 1 cannoli donut 1 lobster tail All were very tasty but the cannoli donut was my favorite! I will go back for more but I will definitely order online the day before for pick up so I don't have to stand in that long line.,1
"My girlfriend and I are huge fans of Cake Boss so for her birthday in Vegas I got her a quarter sheet custom cake - Vanilla cake with the Oreo French filling. Usually, I'm not a fan of Fondant cakes because they tend to taste a little rubbery, but not here! The cake was very light and moist, which was surprising considering how heavy the cake was! The decoration was fabulous and overall, it was a great experience for our party. Thank you!",1
"I had no idea this was the Cake Boss place...cool. So..not utter perfection and my eyes did not roll to the back of my head when sampling, but this place definitely does not deserve anything less than four stars. Yes, the lines are long. Yes, the place is small. No, it's not the cheapest bargain. I say it's a great bakery because the selections are scrumptious. The chocolate hazelnut biscotti and chocolate almond biscotti are fantastic. Great cream puffs also. I will definitely stop there whenever I'm in town. Bonus: the employees are super sweet and eager to serve. So go ahead and jump off the paleo wagon and have some yummy sugary carbo treats just this once :)",1
Very popular spot to get your goodies. Service is a little slow but the cannolis are amazing . Next time I'll have to try the cakes.,1
You might think you know what good cake is. But until you have tried Carlo's Bakery cakes you are dead wrong. The best cake. Moist dense and full of flavor. And don't get me started on the texture of the cream in the lobster tails. It's worth the trip to the second floor in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.,1
"My daughter is a huge fan of the cake boss, so when my girlfriend and I came upon Carlo's on our last day in Vegas, we knew we had to get some stuff to bring home to her and the rest of our kids. We got dark chocolate mousse and a cannoli to have immediately, as it definitely wouldn't stay good on the journey home. Both of these were fantastic. Best ever, honestly. For the kids we got some brownies, cupcakes, and cookies which they thoroughly enjoyed the next day. We got a ton of stuff for about $50, which isn't bad for Vegas at all.",1
"I came here not expecting any thing above average. Wow! Everything exceeded my expectations! The chocolate covered cannoli was amazing and the rainbow cake was delicate, fun and super tasty!",1
"I think your experience depends on many factors here. The line wasn't incredibly long when we went. I ordered a Carlo's donut. Not sure the description at the bakery was super helpful, but it was good! It had the same filling as a cannoli with crispy sprinkles. My husband ordered a brownie, and that was also very good! We got two coffees and managed to find two seats to enjoy our food and drink. It was fun to watch the bakers at work, as well. One of the customers asked the cashier about how often Buddy visits. She said he had been there the past weekend. Would have loved to have met him! :)",1
"- I'm a big fan of ""CAKE BOSS"", so I was really excited to try out Carlo's Bakery up in the Venetian - Tried the lobster tail (~$5) and cannoli (~$4) +Lobster tail was stuffed with a deliciously rich cream, but we found the outside to be ha",1
"Cannoli, good, shell was kinda lacking in flavor, non greasy, the ricotta filling was yummy. Lobster roll, just ok, the phyllo dough was too crispy, the vanilla custard filling had a odd taste and I got a very greasy taste with this one. Cream puffs, absolutely delicious. Light and airy and the custard filling was perfect. I think it's a bit overpriced, but your paying for the name and location.",1
The cannolis were amazing. My kids loved the rainbow cake. My sweet craving was definitely satisfied!,1
"Never had much experience with bakery goods, saw the line so why not. Picked out a few cream puffs, a carrot cupcake, and lobster tails. Overall not super impressed, buttttttt.....the lobster tails really opened my eyes when I took that first bite. I was able to get a fresh batch of them and that flaky crispy texture was so awesome. And I've never ate any filling type dessert with so much creaminess goodness. Ordered 5, and eating the 3rd one as I'm typing this. No rahhhhgretssss",1
"Worthy of the long lines. Had their classic cannoli which was delicious and as good as their flagship bakery in Hoboken. Although, in Hoboken location the fillings are done when you order them. Was to full to try other bake goods but I did when I was at their flagship location. All delicious. I did buy their variety butter cookies at this location to take home.",1
The Cake Boss!!! Wandering through the Venetian I saw the advertisements for Carlos and knew I had to go. What I wasn't prepared for was that everybody else had the same idea. After standing in line for 45 minutes and barely moving I almost walked away. I'm so glad I didn't. I'm a huge fan so it was a little nostalgic for me but the desserts didn't disappoint. The cannoli was Delish better than the ones I've had in NYC. But the red velvet cupcake OMG I have never had a cream cheese frosting taste sooooooo good. Cupcake orgasm If you are in Vegas have time to wait in line and are a fan you definitely have to go here I was a little bummed the employees said Buddy was there earlier and we missed him :( Maybe you will get lucky,1
"Well if you are a foodie, I highly recommend the cannoli and the lobster tails. Cannoli shell wasn't too hard/thick or soggy and the cream filling was rich, creamy & delicious. Good quality chocolate on the chocolate covered cannoli. This is my first time to try the lobster tails ever and I wasn't sure what to expect. The texture of the pastry was chewy & crunchy at the same time. Amazing! I went back the next day to get some more lobsters tails and they were all sold out. . Can't wait for my next trip back to Las Vegas.",1
The chocolate canoli my favorite yum! Lines are a lil hectic but you eventually get the hang of it. Im glad i gave this place a try. Tip: they post cash only signs who knows why....,1
"This place is always busy, the line is well worth it. I'm not a big fan of the cannoli, but the Lobster tails are delicious. Carlos bakery has a website we're you can actually have your favorite dessert shipped to your home.",1
"Cannolis. Bomb. We got lobster tails and chocolate fudge cupcake. Tasty desserts. Also got the water bottle and a free apron cause I purchased $60+ which was awesome! The only downside is, if your coworkers messed up our order, do not blame it on us and show us attitude and frustration ""because we are holding the line""! Don't make faces, you are working in a Carlo's Bakery! Carlo's Bakery!! woman in the cashier!!!",1
"I'm really surprised by some of the negative reviews. This place is AWESOME! I had my doubts because the New York Bakery is highly publicized on tv for Cake Boss. It isn't the cheapest Bakery, actually it's kind of pricey. But, you're not getting basic bakery goods. We got a chocolate eclair, custard filled Lobster Tail, white chocolate strawberry, Neapolitan (THE BEST EVER), cheese danish and a few cookies. Some of the best baked goods I've ever had. It's worth the wait if there's a line... we waited for like 15 minutes. Delicious!",1
"Short and straight. Get the canoli and to all the cake donut lovers like myself, the chocolate cake donut is divine. Yup, it's divine! Don't get it if your not a cake donut lover, it needs to be appreciated. lol!",1
Yummy on all the pastries. It's hard choice to make cause so much to choose from. I ended with eclair w Custer filling and Tarmi MSU and apple cluster.,1
"Okay. So this place is pretty much delicious. I'm very very picky with my chocolate. I tried the strawberry chocolate mousse tower - scrumptious. And the chocolate chip cookies - amazing! My boyfriend tried The tiramisu- pretty good. The carrot cake - bomb! [so he says] Basically, you walk in. Take a number. They call out your number. You order. They prepare it. They call out your number again. You pay. The end. They would have gotten 5 stars, but they don't sell water or milk. Come on! People who eat there are obviously gonna want something to drink. We didn't wait long, because we went on a Wednesday night. But overall, staff is friendly. Desserts are wonderful.",1
"So far it was delicious worth the wait!!! Make sure to grab a number as soon as you get there, you might have to wait about 30 min to an 1 hour. The bakery has good delicious deserts. The strawberry cheesecake is super smooth with a bread crust with a huge sweet strawberry on top, the cannoli has a nice crunch and sweet shell with a delicious cream, you might also want to try their red velvet cupcake too you can taste the delicious cream cheese icing with a red chocolate moist bread. The only down side about this bakery is the wait to be honest but its expected since it is new and of course Cake Boss is famous for his deserts and who wouldn't want to try a piece of this now that they are in the west coast! Hope you all enjoy and have the patience to wait for your sweets!",1
"i had gone to the one in new york and i loved the lobster tail pastry that i had there! was happy to find out there was a bakery here too in vegas..again i got the lobster tail..its shaped like one..does not tastes like one lol..crispy, flaky outside..creamy delicious vanilla pastry cream inside..yummm",1
We ordered a unicorn cake and didn't give Carlo's much to go on. They worked with the ideas we had and they hit it out of the park! The cake turned out beautifully!!! I am completely thrilled with the results and would not hesitate to recommend Carlo's to everyone. The service from start to finish was professional and beyond helpful. Thank you for helping make this a memorable 21st!!!,1
"This bakery has some great Italian pastries, like cannolis and lobster claws. They are pretty close to New York bakeries. Great assortment: cookies, cheesecakes, biscotti, shortcake, specialty cakes. Always a line to order so you know it has to be good.",1
"So after we ate at buddy's restaurant we wanted to try dessert at the bake shop. Obviously we watch the show. I loved the lobster tails and napoleons!!! They were everything I was hoping them to be! Lol I was reading the reviews before I went and everyone was complaining about poor guest service and having to wait in line, but if u watch the show, there's always a line and it's ran pretty much the same way he runs the original! As for me I didn't have a problem with the wait, we went an hour before closing and didn't wait long. The counter people were nice. It's kinda pricey tho, I spent close to $80 on 13 pastries, only cause I was so excited for them to be here! I pretty much splurged! It was worth it tho, I want to go back for more lobster tails!",1
"August 2, 2014 Stood in line for over an hour for this? Totally worth it! No matter what it is that you purchase, they pastries are all delicious and not too sweet! My favorite is their Napoleon. Their cheesecake is, according to my mom, better than the ones I brought back from New York. Carlo's is worth the wait and you will not regret it at all! Promise!",1
Cannolis were so fresh and amazing! Everything is so good! And you get a free apron when you spend more than $35,1
Came on my first day in Vegas and made sure to go back before I left. Both times the staff was able to clear a crowd quickly. I wish there was a place to sit and eat besides the two chairs they provide because I'd be here all day. The first visit I got an Oreo cupcake and chocolate mousse. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was delicious (I normally hate frosting). The mousse was so rich and fluffy. The second visit we got another Oreo cupcake and my boyfriend got a caramel lobster tail. The cupcake was just as good as on the first visit. The lobster tail was delicious! (I'm not even a fan of caramel.) The filling was so light and soft. It was not that sweet which we loved since it was stuffed with it and it could have been overwhelming if it was too sweet. Going to try to squeeze in a third visit because the pastries are just that good.,1
"EXPENSIVE! Goodness, be prepared to empty your bank account as you walk in. Really good pastries though so I'll give them that. My order consisted of the lobster tail, a chocolate mousse cake, and a cupcake. I worked on the lobster tail from Saturday night and finally finished it when I got back home Wednesday morning. Not something to be eaten in one sitting, at least I couldn't do it. The chocolate cake was pretty good even though I had to toss out the strawberries by the time I got to it. Sadly, I've yet to eat the cupcake. 4 items cost roughly $10 each so don't be shocked. Its something to try at least once, that's for sure.",1
"We stopped in after dinner at Buddy V's to grab some something sweet for later in the evening...way too stuffed after that amazing meal! I ordered a cannoli and enjoyed it in my hotel room before going to bed - sinful, I know!",1
"Salted Carmel cake and cupcake are both to die for! I definitely preferred the cake because it was a bit lighter, but both were great.",1
"Days after coming home from my vacation im still dreaming of these amazing pastries, i will go and get them every single time im in las vegas! They are so delicious,do yourself a favor and buy extras to have later!",1
"Finally had the chance to go check out Carlo's bakery. We went on a Wednesday around 12:30 so the line wasn't as long. I was super excited to get the lobster tail and my hubby wanted the canolis. We waited in line for our turn but it took a little long due to the ladies in front of us buying shirts. I swear they asked for every shirt in every size! There should definitely be a pastry line and a different line for merch. Once we ordered we got: Lobster tail Cream puff Canoli Eclair Pecan cookie Everything was good, minus the canolis...I know right?!? Very disappointed. Not what I expected at all. The lobster tail was very good. All in all, I would come out again to try other items.",1
"I was super excited to visit them since I am a great fan of the show, but was afraid that it may have all been a hype. My fears however were completely unfounded as I discovered that their cannoli were the best I have ever had, the shell was crunchy since the attendants go to the back and pipe the cream upon ordering. it did take quite sometime for the order to be ready but it was well worth the wait. Their dark chocolate mousse cake was decadent, creamy, and not too sweet.",1
One word for you CANNOLI. Totally absolutely yummy! Taste just like the ones from their New York bakery I loveeee that they have the same Recipes I thought it was going to taste more like a buffet cannoli just boring with no flavor since it was inside of a casino but I was wrong!!!! So delicious!,1
"I was finally able to come to this shop at the end of my Vegas trip. We came here around 11-12ish and there was no line at all (how lucky). First thing I was wow'ed at: they have clear windows so you can see what is going on in the kitchen :) one of the bakers was assembling a strawberry shortcake, which looked so good. The amount of strawberries they put into the cakes are CRAZY (in a good way). I was seriously about to buy a whole cake for myself, but I was flying the same day so not possible, sadly. Although the shop is small, they are able to have A LOT of different kinds of pastries. From cookies to cupcakes to puff pastry - it took me a while for me to decide on what to get. Their cannolis are not displayed, so you have to ask them about it. Or least I didn't see them from their huge selection haha. Anyways, I finally decided to get their famous lobster tail and cannoli. I wish I was able to order more, but I was just so full, ugh. The lobster tail was so crunchy and so flavorful! The choux (?) cream had a strong vanilla flavor to it. I had imagined the lobster tail to be bigger, but its fine because it takes me a while to finish a lobster tail anyways. I would have to say that this is the best lobster tail I had ever have (even better than Mikes Pastry's in Boston). I'm usually not a huge fan of cannolis, but the ones here blew me away. The cannoli itself had so much flavor and I could literally eat it as a cookie. The cream adds the perfect touch to it since it does get dry. I would love to come back here again, but at the Hoboken location!",1
These cakes are to die for. It's a good place to go if your a fan of the show and a fan of cakes and pastries. All made in house so extremely fresh and a high quality. Also selling cake boss merchandise as well. It's well worth a visit but make sure you know what you want while your queuing as if you make a decision at the end it holds up the line!,1
"The best brownies I have ever had in my entire life are found at Carlo's Bakery! I was in Morrisville, NJ on a business trip and visited Carlo's there. I bought one brownie and took it on the airplane with me. Mid-flight, I decided to eat it. I couldn't believe how perfectly delicious it was -- the right balance of walnuts to the brownie and frosted. I love all of those combinations. The brownie was so good that I wished I had bought a couple more to take home. So -- when I was driving from Southern California to Utah recently, I stopped at the Venetian -- walked all over that place to find Carlo's. Stood in line for half an hour and bought 6 brownies for the rest of my trip. I will never miss the opportunity to stop into Carlo's for a brownie. Next time, I have to try an eclair.",1
We saw this bakery as a recommendation when we were researching what to do and eat in Vegas. When we got there I didnt know how to pick! Everything looked exquisite. I asked what the specialty's were and they said Lobster tails and Cannolis. However- I wasnt in the mood for any of those so I chose a chocolate covered cheesecake and the coconut chinese cookie with a chocolate droplet. Both were very good but that cookie was amazing! The texture was very good and just the right amount of coconut and chocolate. I wish I could go back and order a Cannoli. Maybe my next trip to Vegas!,1
Reminds me of the east coast pastries I love. Coming from Connecticut to California it is very very hard to find Italian pastries that are even decent. I love coming home with two or three boxes of pastries for my family and they are so good they're gone in a few hours. The lobster tails are my favorite. They are a bit pricey but it's Vegas and the Venetian I don't expect it to be that cheap. Highly recommend!,1
"My parents have been here a few times, and it was our first time at Carlo's Bakery. We enjoyed these bakery treats so much that we dropped by a second time before heading home. On our first visit, we had these items boxed up to go: chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies, cream puffs, eclairs and terra misu. On the second visit, we had brownies, meringue cookies, lobster claws, cream puffs and a mini cheesecake. My faves were the eclairs, cream puffs and mini cheesecake. These classic Italian desserts satisifed our sweet tooth, and were not too sweet.",1
"My friends and I visited there today 2 of us had m&m cookies and 1 had the sprinkle cookie. They were all really tasty, they were just the right consistency they weren't hard but the weren't really soft.",1
"Everybody by now knows what Carlo's Bakery is because of the show Cake Boss. Carlos Bakery has become the Applebee's of bakeries with locations across the US. I was in search of something to nosh on for breakfast and decided on a Cannoli from Carlo's. My expectations weren't too high but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the cannoli was. I did not try any other items from Carlo's, so this review is based solely on a single Cannoli. Great job!",1
"The lobster tail is delicious! The ordering and checking out was fast! The cannolis were good too, but kind of priCing. Overall great quality!",1
"This place never looked like much and it ALWAYS has long lines. This time the line was short so why not? We got a salted caramel horn, an almond croissant, brownie, and some other pastry that left me in heaven. Everything was stellar and fresh and delish. How good can a brownie be, right? No this was different. I think the difference here is they toast the nuts first, which added a great flavor. I will definitely line up again for this place. YUM.",1
The Bavarian cream filled doughnut was excellent. Jelly filled was also good Carlo or buddy whoever I'll be back.,1
"We were visiting Las Vegas for a week and I was very excited to check out Carlo's Bakery... Big fan of the show. It is located in the Venetian Forum shop right across from Bobby's V Restaurant. The place was pretty busy so they had workers that she can't even take your orders on a iPad they were really patient they explain anything that you needed to explain. So customer service was pretty good. Once your order was ready they call you up by name and you receive your order from there while you wait you could actually look and see the baker's making the cake and all the goodies that they sell. Once we got back to the hotel and try some other stuff, it was pretty good but it's not worth on the $40 that we spend on everything. So it is pretty expensive I think it's just because of the show was on TV. Cannoli was very sweet that I didn't finish it rainbow cake and velvet cake was just okay as well. I had kind of better that was really moist. Because this in a little refrigerator so it stays the kind of little old or still. Overall excited to experience the cake and goodies. Maybe it was one of those one-and-done type things",1
"I am crazy about this place. Bustling with people, this place has some absolutely mouth melting desserts. I visited this bakery on independence Day and there was a host of cupcakes n other creations in the colours of red, white n blue. Simply delicious.",1
"I love Buddy's show and have wanted to come here.... we got tiramisu, a connoli, a pastry called lobster something an a baby cream puff. It was good but I think I may have thought to high of this place ... it was very small but clean. We ended up going over to buddy's restaurant across the street which was awesome!",1
They have good baked goods here cakes cookies etc. long line very pricey so don't thinking you get a donut for a dollar more like 4 to 5 dollars I would recommend just trying it is not a bad place I would go here again,1
"Little pricy, but they have such a huge assortment. We ordered a lobster tail, a couple of made to order cannoli's, some fondant cookies and a few other goodies. Presentation is on point. The lobster tail was very flaky and delicious with even tastier cream filling. I recommend trying it if you're on the fence about what to order because the selection is so big. We were lucky to be there during the holidays because their fondant cookies with all the festive designs will make great gifts.",1
"The famous 'Cake Boss' bakery is located in the Venetian hotel and it was a bit stressful to find. My girlfriend is a huge fan of the show so it was a must. The array of cakes and cookies and cannolis is extremely impressive considering the space is quite small. We ordered a lobster tail and a cannoli, both of which were quite generously filled with sweet cream. Both cakes were delicious and quite large. No seating, as has been said before, but we found a table nearby. Enjoyed my experience overall.",1
"Ok I got the variety for 25 bucks it was ok, I wonder if it taste the same in the east coast.",1
"In Vegas for a convention again. Tried Carlos again. This time, service was great. Red Velvet cake and cheesecake were great. Was told that the lobster claw was amazing. Much..Much ...Much better!",1
"The Cannolis are amazing here, so fresh and tasty. However, the Caramel lobster tail wasn't so much, but the manager replaced it for me to a Choco hazelnut which I really liked it!",1
"Super excited about this one! The cannoli was AMAZING!!!!! It's a little pricey but is to be expected. The staff was super friendly! I got a 6 pack of cupcakes, a brownie, a chocolate chip cookie and a cannoli for just under $30.",1
Amazing. This is a must stop for any foodie. From cakes to Italian pastries the only problem youll have is deciding what to to pick. Staff is super friendly and fast.,1
"Location was great, bakery was clean, staff friendly and efficient. Canoili was heavenly. Cakes a little too dry. Prices were typical Vegas. Would go back for the canoili!",1
"We had a hard time finding this because the maps at the hotel are not very good. After asking several employees, WE MADE IT! I had been reading posts for months on Yelp, didn't know what to expect honestly. We arrived around 10:30am and there were hardly any people there. Ordered and paid quickly. Make sure you look at the prices because their things aren't cheap. I enjoyed my experience and I would go back. I ordered the lobster tail and 2 M&M cookies. My mom ordered a cream puff and my sister a cheesecake.",1
So many delicious options that its hard to choose. You can't go to Vegas and not grab dessert at Carlos Bakery. Service was friendly and efficient.,1
"Completely love this! I was excited to try and sample some of their desserts, and I'm happy to have shared them with my cousins~! They do not know who Buddy is, but they did enjoy the samples. They'll thank me later if they ever watch the show what we sampled: chocolate cannoli, chocolate merengue with I believe walnut?, coffee cream puff, and lobster tail! My brother and one of my cousin favored the cannoli, while my other cousin and I favored the lobster tail. I am craving to have some more!",1
"My girlfriend bought me a surprise birthday cake from here, and it was absolutely delicious. It tasted very good and was nicely decorated. I will come back again despite the crowds and wait",1
"It smells good as you walk by. The pastries are good, but there are two lines you have to stand in. The first is to place your order, and the other is wait to pick up your order. It would be helpful to have to more cashiers ringing people out.",1
LOVE Carlo's Bakery. My husband convinced me to go to Vegas by saying I could eat some treats here. Sooo glad I allowed him to talk me into it. We came in the late afternoon. There was a pretty long line. I was nervous as I had read here how slow it was. I found this to not be the case. We waited in line past the restrooms for about 20 minutes. The girl in charge of the line did a great job at keeping the line moving and nicely telling people who were cutting where the end was. Once inside it was a bit smaller than it should be. I ordered my lobster tails and some cupcakes. The person who helped me was wonderful and called me up soon to check my order. Then I had to wait to be called up again to pay. Thankfully they opened a second register which made it much quicker. I've had one of the lobster tails. Yummy and soooo worth it. Loving them. Cupcakes are actually nice and moist and delicious. A little pricey but worth it in my opinion. Definitely would recommend this place especially the lobster tails.,1
"I finally got to visit carlo's bake shop this weekend. little difficult to find but ask around and you will be successful. Don't be discouraged with the long line and make sure u grab a number as soon as you arrive. It's a very small location so the line is mostly so it won't be crowded inside store. Very friendly employees. Well waiting in line one of the employees was walking around with a menu to give u a heads up on what to order when your time comes. She also has no problem taking your picture under the Carlo's bake shop sign. Ask employees for their favorite treat. Food: I was not disappointed with the pastries. Canolis, lobster tails and cream omg amazing!!!!! Fairly priced!!!!! Don't get discouraged with the line trust me it's worth the wait!",1
"So we almost got out of the line several times, but felt committed since this was our second attempt at trying Carlo's. I'm glad we waited. We got the black and white cookie, lobster tail, cream puff and cannoli. I would've given the tail a three, only based on my preferences, and I have no point of reference. However, the cannoli with chocolate chip filling was awesome! Granted, I am a California girl who has only tried some in north beach in SF, but these were really, really fantastic and deserve five stars. However, I gotta say that I feel the line and ordering process could be streamlined. We waited an hour and we started just past the window of the shop. It seemed it could've been run faster with more help in the wrap up/check out department. If you don't mind waiting, get the cannoli! The other items were tasty too, but that stood out. Would love to try a cake next time!",1
"Pastries and baked goods were absolutely delicious! We completely stumbled upon this little bakery while we were on a trip in Las Vegas and it was definitely worth it. Prices are a little bit expensive considering that it's just a simple brownie, cookie or cannoli but also considering that it's a pretty famous bakery because of the show Cake Boss it's definitely worth the trip. Would recommend to try at least one thing there but don't go crazy otherwise you will spend a lot of money",1
"California Cheesecake well worth the wait, great assortment of different flavors, not to mention the free samples, line wrapped around the side of the building. ..",1
So i called 24 hrs before i realized i needed an emergency cake due to the fact that the cake i had order was not gonna be delivered what i had asked for so i needed a cake as soon as possible i called on a Saturday at 730 am and i was able to talk to elizabeth such nice girl completely caring then i had the pleasure to speak to Joanna the supervisor such nice lady was able to get the custom cake order inn for me for that same day at 2 pm this place is amazing super understanding and caring i don't know any other bakery that would do that for you in such short notice u guys are awesome thank youuuu so muchhhhh btw my cake was only 50 bucks n i got exactly what i wanted sooooooo happy u made my daughters bday that much better and the kids demolished the cake soooo bomb,1
"Being a huge fan of the show Cake Boss, I had to make a quick stop at the famous Carlo's Bakery inside the Venetian. Despite the heavy crowd, I managed to get a hazelnut cream puff fairly quickly. It was light, fluffy, and yummy. It lived up to my hype, but was way too expensive. I would come here mainly for the large selection of desserts.",1
"Service was great. Friendly people. Very cute looking desserts. The dessert was not too sweet. I find it delicious. This place was a bit pricey though. But then again, you are paying for what you get on the strip. They probably pay high rent expenses and so on.",1
Pros ·Delicious food ·Nice services ·Many varieties ·Unique Cons ·Long line(I don't think it's worth it to wait that long but than again I am impatient). ·pricey but you are in Vegas so i expect to be a little expensive.,1
"Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a ""Cake Boss"" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from ""Next Great Baker"" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one. The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying ""I'm never washing my face again"" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included! One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back! Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount. Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite! Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again. Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli. Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush. Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great. Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.",1
"It gets 4 stars because of the lobster tails & cannolis and because I love Cake Boss. I took off 1 star because of the red velvet cupcake which was just not good at all. I'm a red velvet snob and expected a red velvet cupcake from Carlo's to be like everything else I've tried there.. Amazing. It wasn't. Hard to describe what exactly was wrong but didn't even taste like red velvet to me. Anyway, lobster tails are my favorite, hands down! They're amazing. I literally constantly crave them. My friend wanted them to add some chocolate on top of hers when we went and they wouldn't do it but I'm fairly certain that would be really good. Their cannolis.. Mm so good! I visited the Carlo's in Hoboken a few years ago and had a cannoli so I had to try the ones here. I had the regular one and the chocolate one. Both are great! My friend got a hazelnut covered cream puff in addition to some lobster tails and she said it was really good. It is a must try for me for next time. I spent about $28 (I think) for two lobster tails, two cannolis and two red velvet cup cakes. Also, there were a lot of people there in a small space but they do try to get to the next number (yes, you have to take a number when you get there) quickly. I didn't have any issues with the customer service either.. Everyone was friendly! I would, however, recommend a way for customers to be able to know what is in the display cases before ordering. Even while ordering at the one with the pastries, you're unable to see the cupcakes case as people are standing everywhere while waiting and vice versa. I probably missed out on something simply because I couldn't see it and didn't know it was there. After reading some other reviews, it seems there is now a line to get in which should alleviate that problem.",1
"The classic cannoli I had was great! I'm not usually a huge fan of cream-filled pastries but this was delicious, not too sweet or goopy. I also picked up their one pound bag of mixed cookies and biscotti which I brought home to my sister and dad, they loved them. Why the four stars? There was a long line and when I finally got to ordering they were out of lobster tails and it would have been an extra 15 minute wait. Overall, Carlo's did not disappoint and it's cool to be able to say I've tried Cake Boss pastries!",1
"Lobster tail was out of this world good. Read some of the other reviews and I'm not getting that there was an alcohol taste in the filling. Perhaps put the daiquiri down first and then take a bite? Either way, drove 9 hours and felt it was worth stopping in. Line was a handful of people. Took 5 minutes to get in and out circa 1000 am on a Friday!",1
Visited bakery while in Vegas. It was a nice treat! Also- flew back home with bakery goods. Perfect packages for traveling.,1
I absolutely love their cannolis but they are very pricey. I've been lucky that the few times I've visited the lines were not long at all. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.,1
"I Love Buddy and had to make two separate pit stops here on back to back days. The first day we waited 20 minutes or so for the strawberry shortcake, a cannoli, and a lemon sugar cookie. The cannolis looked so good on tv but I was not a fan. The following day we went back for another strawberry shortcake and more of the sugar cookies, lemon and raspberry. Spent around $45 in total! We will be back!",1
"Decided to try this Bakery as I have heard great reviews and there seems to be a lot of ""buzz"" surrounding this location. The staff was awesome! I came in, took a look at the choices (quite a lot to choose from), and asked one of the staff members what is the most popular item/what does everyone order. He mentioned the cannolis - so I had to try them! Wow - they were amazing! Fantastic quality! A bit pricey (about $4.50/$5 per cannoli), however, loved trying this bakery.",1
"I'm not going to read the reviews here because when I went yesterday, i had a pleasant experience. I'll make this simple and quick. 1: go in the morning before 9:45, maybe 10 at the latest. 2: know what you want to help speed up the process when the person takes your order. 3: Lobster tails, and crumb cake. Those are my my favorites. It's up to your pallet in what you want to eat. Buy one of each of everything!",1
Wow this bakery is the only one I seen in ca . All there pasty are made fresh and are very delicious. Yes it's pricey but it's so worth every Pennie . I love there cannoli and cookies,1
"Buddy's baked goods are not overrated. I wanted to sample everything!! I visited Carlo's twice during my trip. The 2nd time especially I got greedy, ordered too many items, ate them all, couldn't stop. SO GOOD.",1
On our Vegas trip we had to stop by here and get some sweet treats!! Everything taste really good. We have been here twice and both times there are long lines! But it's worth it!,1
"I loved go to Carlo's bakery at the Palazzo. Thankfully the lines weren't long, at all, and the service and pastries were top-notch. I will definitely be going back and bringing my guests who visit.",1
"I was hoping for desserts as good as seen on the tv show and I was not dissatisfied. I ordered the Oreo lobster tail, peanut butter cupcake, chocolate mousse and chocolate cannoli. The cupcake was moist and very wonderful hint of peanut butter with the best frosting. The lobster tail was flaky and filled with the best creamy Oreo filling. The chocolate mousse was creamy and perfectly edible. The chocolate cannoli was the best I've ever had with a great crispy outside covered in chocolate with a fantastic tasting filling. I'm going back tomorrow before my flight to stock up on items to bring home.",1
"I've never had a canoli, so we gave Carlo's Bake Shop a try. There was a good size line and it seemed very disorganized. First you order your baked items, then you wait in a cluster -""F"" of people. Next they call you up, show you your baked item, then back to the cluster to wait again. Then you get called by the register to pay. It's very odd and I'm sure there is a better way to do this. HOWEVER, the canoli was so yummy. Being a western girl, I just don't get canolis on the street corner here.",1
"So, here I sit back home watching Cake Boss on my DVR. I think I should tell how my adventure of trying to bring back bakery items from Las Vegas to Hawaii. I was afraid TSA wouldn't let our so delicious cannolis and lobster claws onto carry on because of the cream. I really wanted our friends and employees to taste these oh so special Italian desserts. In hindsight, maybe I should have asked the Palazzo to store it in the freezer overnight. We had an early flight in the morning. I also should have packaged the items separately. I put them in our suitcase and packed clothes around them and hoped for the best. When we finally arrived home, the box did suffer from being smashed. It also suffered some from the varying air moisture content. The creams were still good, but they did not look pretty. The saddest part was because of the moisture content, the cannolis were no longer crispy. The lobster claws were beat up, but they are good. I am still eating them. I wish I wasn't. I'd rather be loosing weight, but they taste good. I wish I could fix the cannolis. I haven't given up on this idea. I know I'll try again.",1
Long lines. Had to wait about 20 minutes to order. Bought a single desert cake for about $10. The mini dark chocolate cake was very good. Their shop is not on their outdated directories in 'mall'. They are located close to Barney's.,1
Stopped by for some cannolis and a lobster tail or two. Was pleasantly surprised that there was no line. That changed to a line of 20 just minutes later. Always feel satisfied after visiting. Thanks,1
We had a long wait in line about 30 to 40 minutes. It was worth the wait the crumb cake was on the stale side we did get our money back from that. But other than that the cupcakes the lobster tail was delicious. It was worth the wait in line,1
Pricy but good pastry. Wish they have a more central location on the strip. The crowd wasn't as busy as the NY location. Smaller store for sure,1
"I was fortunate enough to visit Carlo's bakery without the long lines (I went close to closing). We ate lobster tails probably everyday of our 4 day trip, they were so so good! The cream inside is amazing and the dough is flaky and just the right amount of sweetness. We did not try anything else, but I highly recommend the lobster tails.",1
"I consider myself a connoisseur of pastries. Carlos didn't disappoint...nevermind the endless selections you have or the prices. I've gone three times in the last few weeks, and each time I get the meringue cookie, strawberry shortcake and LOBSTER TAIL. If you like flaky, crunchy, creamy, and sweet (how could you NOT) you must get a lobster tail. The cream inside this croissant like pastry is perfect, not too sweet and absolutely decadent. Customer service is great...but be ready to wait, as it's located inside the Venetian.",1
1st time in Vegas. I love your Lobster tail !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Looks like out of all the celebrity chefs in Vagas you have it right.,1
"Service is quick and friendly, raspberry regauela(sp)? Was my fave! Was outta control had to try everything! Thanks Carlo and family!",1
"Absolutely amazing! Super pricey but definitely worth it for the pastries. Food, good but for real Italian food I've had better for the price. Great for a romantic dinner with a great view though!",1
"Had to make a trip to come here because I love the show! It was quite hard to find and really small. Long line, but the price wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It was a great place to stop by once because of the novelty.",1
This restaurant never disappoints visually it's very satisfying to see rows and rows of beautifully decorated pastries. The strawberry shortcake is awesome. You can also get tshirts coffee mugs and other gifts. Wish that we had this in our town!!!,1
Excellent place. A lot of variety. I wish I could afford everything on display. Definitely will be back. Just need to make sure I save before returning since I want to make sure I try more than one dessert.,1
I just visited Carlo's and I was very pleased. I got the cannoli and it was really good. They passed out cake samples to the people that were in line. It was good so I got a cupcake. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I waited in line for almost an hour. There was only one girl ringing up orders but she was also taking orders. Maybe they should have 2 cashiers and the other people taking orders to help speed up the line. Other than that I enjoyed going there.,1
I was pretty dang excited to eat their goodies. Huge fan of the show. We waited about 30 minutes to get into the store. But was entertained watching them make a cake through the window. The chef was really nice and kept waving to my girls. We ordered fresh donuts that were amazing! Couldn't believe how yummy. Orders a cupcake. You have to try cake right? It was good but then we are the lobster tail!! Oh my it was all it was cracked up to be. Amazing!! The servers were nice and I loved how it came in the boxes and tied with bakers twine just like the show.,1
$3.50 for the red velvet cupcake which was so moist and tasty. I was mostly impressed with the frosting and the fact that it wasn't ultra sweet like most places but creamy just the way I like it. No line on a weekday afternoon although there was some confusion as to how and where to order. Limited bar stool seating also made it hard to enjoy my new sweet.,1
"Finally, tried the canoli and it was okay as I had better. HOWEVER - the Napoleon and the Lobster Tail is a must! The best I have ever had and so worth the wait.",1
"Had my wedding cake done here and it was amazing! It came out exactly how I wanted it too and tasted great! We had white cake, fresh strawberries, and chocolate mouse inside the cake! I highly recommend buying your wedding cake from here! Amazing job! I even got lucky and got to watch it be made!",1
Good sweets if your looking for something good it's here at Carlo's Bakery in the Venetian hotel,1
"The only negative is the long line most of the day. Oddly, we found it much quieter around lunch time. There are so many amazing treats that you have to go back and try more. Everything was delicious, and the staff very friendly and helpful.",1
"Given the popularity of this bakery, we waited 1 hour to experience all the delicious goodies we always see on The Cake Boss. They have windows on one side of the bakery so you can watch the bakers prepare all the desserts. Staff was extremely busy but still friendly. We bought the Boston Cream, hazelnut cream puff, chocolate meringue, vanilla meringue, & of course cannoli. All delicious!!! We'll be coming back on our next visit!",1
"Waiting in line no bog deal u can watch them make cakes and stuff, had the chocolate canoli was very good, best I had ever had, very good filling . Took home the Napoleon cake, was very good also. Price is a little high but I understand why, quality cost.",1
"Went to the bakery to bring things home to MN. My daughter is a huge Cake Boss fan. We got a tshirt, cookies to bring home and a lemon tart for myself. The lemon tart was awesome! Staff was great helping with the tshirt and getting a gift card (niece and nephew will be coming next week!).",1
"After watching tons of episodes of cake boss, you can bet that I really wanted to try these seemingly mouth watering desserts. I was absolutely thrilled that I could finally taste it, and not just imagine how it would taste! The appearance of the store imitates the Hoboken store from the show, and there's also a window where you can watch people decorating things, which is kind of cool. When I went, it was only the second day it was open, so it was pretty crowded. You take a number, and when it gets called you get to order your desserts. Then you have to get that same number called again so you can get it all packaged and pretty and pay for your stuff. There's not a lot of sitting room, so plan to take your desserts home. If you're really impatient, you could always sit on a bench by the ""canals"" in the Venetian and eat them while watching the gondolas. EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS! I settled on the ""lobstertail"", which is a pastry stuffed with I think it's french cream, since it seemed to be something sort of unique to Carlo's Bakery. It was so good! The outside was flaky and crispy, and the inside was rich without being too sweet. It was so perfect! I'm definitely looking forward to trying more desserts! The big problem will just be what to get next!",1
Came here after eating at Buddy's V's Ristorante they had quite a lot to Choose from its a little on the pricey side so be prepared for that. Can be crowded at times so it's best to come out early when their shelves are fully stocked out and fresh. Had the famous Lobster Tail it was highly recommended and it was great crispy on the outside very creamy on the inside also their connoli is good too. Overall their process of getting in and out could be faster.,1
Best desserts ever tasted recommend going to buy their desserts.Very creative and awesome,1
You have to get the cannolis. They are the best. Very reasonably priced. I thought they would be more expensive but they're not. I think the next time I'm in vegas i will have to take home a dozen of them! Highly recommend,1
"I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the lines they get. You would think if they get a lot of people, they would get just a tad bit more staff. The bakery is very small, so I guess I understand why the long lines. The cannoli was soooo worth the wait! That, and the chocolate dipped cookie (it's half white, half milk chocolate). Yum yum yum!",1
Ordered a celebration cake online to be ready when I arrived to Vegas . The customer service was excellent. They even offered to write Happy Birthday on it for me when I realized my candles would not fit right on the cake at the time of pick up. I received many compliments for the taste as well. I will definitely order again while in town.,1
"This place is soooo good!!! Not too overpriced, but the taste of their desserts and pastries is worth every penny! I would have given them 5 stars, but I had to wait in line for 1 hour just to get into the bakery. I had my kids with me and they were not doing well with the wait so I had them stand against a wall (totally out of the way of everybody), but security there at The Venetian was very rude and said they were in the way of traffic (they were not) and made them come back in line with us! Would come back again, but I wouldn't bring my kids next time...and I would be prepared for the wait and have my comfy shoes on!!",1
"I have wanted to go back east just to taste these baked goods. I wanted to know if it was really as good as everyone on TV was saying. I mean come on, people waiting three hours or more in line just cuz their on TV?! Well I only had to wait 45 mins here in Las Vegas and it was REALLY WORTH THE WAIT! I haven't been able to find a GOOD cannoli in this town to save my life! You sure can here. And the rest of the pastries are to die for. I'll be going back over and over. Thank you Buddy for coming to Vegas!!!! It's a much shorter drive to go to the Strip then to have to fly to New Jersey.",1
Went early on a tuesday ..had a hard time finding it in the big venetian .they didnt have all the pastry ready so early i guess.I got a canoli tower 7.95$ and fudge cup cake yummy yummy yummy !!!,1
"Don't try to purchase everything because the pastries look cute. It wasn't a long wait, maybe 5-10 minutes or so on Sunday morning, I ordered 1 Lobster tail based on the reviews, it was AWESOME. not too sweet, and freshly made~ remember not to purchase too many varieties, it will disappoint you!",1
"Had the Neapolitan and the mini cannoli. I've never heard of this place prior to coming to his place but the baked goods are pretty good. Layers of the Neapolitan were still very crispy, and the cannoli were very tasty.",1
"Was excited to discover a Carlo's Bakery across from the hotel I was staying at. Planned to hit it first thing in the morning for my much needed coffee and a pastry or pastries...don't judge. Got there about an hour after they opened and was pleasantly surprised on my a few people ahead of me. The line took longer then I thought it should take govern the amount of people but I was ok with it as I was able to fully decide what i wanted when it was my turn. Everything looked absolutely delicious. After resisting to order one of everything I settled on mini connolis, cannoli tart, peanut butter chocolate cupcake, and a variety of cookies. EVERYTHING was delicious. Melted in your mouth good. Minus a star for not having coffee. Apparently the machine wasn't working? ? Bakery with no coffee is just a sin in my opinion. Next time I'm in this neck of the woods I'll be back to try a few more things. Hopefully they get the coffee thing worked out.",1
"I was in Vegas this past weekend. My party we had a surprised birthday for one of my girl. I was in Vegas looking everywhere for a bakery. I found this on Yelp. When I got to this bakery, I was surprised it was Cake Boss. The service was good. The lady who helped me was very detailed what they offered. The cakes were nice and presentable. I bought a strawberry shortcake for one of my girl's birthday with a beautiful tag. The cake was delicious. The line got busy right after I bought my cake. They had a deal going on, giving out free mug or water bottle.",1
Cupcakes here are pretty good. Cake is nice and moist and the icing is not overly sweet. Would definitely come back.,1
"Friends and I enjoyed this place. Great view of the back kitchen where the staff is busy making all the baked goods. The line looked long, but is was maybe less then a 25 min wait. The only issue was that the Rugelach was too dense.",1
"BEST RED VELVET CUPCAKE! I went to all the cupcake bake shop in Las Vegas and this bake shop has the best red velvet. My mom will be ordering her wedding cake here soon. The only thing I didn't like was one of the employee is really rude. This was my first time coming here, so ordering I didn't how they do it. I was only going to ask her a question but held up her hand to my face. She didn't even let me finish. If I come back to this shop I hope she will not be there to do this to me again.",1
"We are a fan of the show and have always wanted to go to their main store, but when my daughter and I heard about the shop on the strip we had to go. Their selection is not large, but what they do have is very good. My daughter and go the lobster tails and HOLY COW they were amazing. The next day (Sunday) we arrived early so we could get some goodies for the family, but they did not have any Cannolis. We got some more lobster tails, biscotti and White Chocolate Mouse Cake. My wife was very happy with the cake and my other daughter was disappointed they did not have any Connolis, but was very happy with the lobster tail.",1
"This was a must stop for my Cake Boss loving daughter. There was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad and the girls were able to view the bakers at work. We ordered a cannoli, strawberry short cake, and a red velvet cupcake. The cannoli was FANTASTIC!! The strawberry shortcake had A LOT of whipped cream, but it was yummy. And the red velvet cupcake? You'll have to take my daughter's word for it, she wouldn't share! I wanted a lobster tail, but it was too much for this trip, next time FOR SURE!!",1
Loved it! Ever since watching the show on TLC I have wanted to try their things but they were located on the other side of the country. We went a litter overboard with pastries but I have no regrets! There are a ton of people there so be sure to get your ticket quickly so that you are not waiting too long. It was about 20 minutes from the time we got the ticket till we got what we ordered... not to shabby for a place this popular!,1
"Loved it in 2014, purchased $72 worth of treats, loved the lobster tails best so wasted no time getting that this time with my 6 month old at the time I July of 2016. Buddy your lobster tail creme was the first thing other than milk that I let my son taste ever! You can be his Godfatha.",1
"I walked by here and didn't know what it was, but the line intrigued me- and I'm a sucker for pastries. So I waited and I waited and I finally entered the bakery. Waited and waited again and finally got to order. Waited and waited again and finally got to pay for and receive my order. So yes. You must be patient. But that lobster tail is AMAZING and I'm considering stopping by once more before leaving sin city.. A bit pricey and could likely be more efficient. Lobster tail = so good. Very crispy and flaky and the filling was rich. Cannoli = OK. I don't normally eat cannolis though Mini white chocolate mousse = excellent Red velvet cupcake = nothing memorable",1
"The bake shop was located in a pretty secluded spot in the Venetian . There was a long line out the door, around 8:30pm. We waited about 35-40 minutes in line but it wasn't too bad since an employee kept walking around giving us delicious samples ;) I tried the cannoli, red velvet cupcake and caramel cupcake. The red velvet was definitely my favorite!",1
"We had a discount coupon of Carlo's Bake Shop by Venetian for our stay, that excite me to visit Carlo's. I found some Interesting cakes with snowman face as Christmas was approaching.. they were really CUTE worth eating hehe :-) Carlo's had lots of variety in terms of cookies/crumcakes/bisccoti/cannolis. We got there early in the morning after our venetian suite checkout and Carlo was bombarded with Carlo's lovers.We were in queue for almost 30 minutes.....Gosh! But definately worth waiting :-) Got 2 huge bags from there with thousands of calories haha :-)",1
"Best Cup Cakes I ever had. Brownie was average or below average. But the cup cakes were excellent. Great frosting. They should win awards if they have not. Long line out the door. Like 30 minutes to get cup cakes. No seating. But great cup cakes. Employees manning counter was a mess. Clean counters. Employees running around like chickens, with their heads cut off. Took like five times, to get them, to get my order right. Definitely some miscommunication, between ordering, packing, paying, and pickup. The disaster service, was worth the aggravation. For the Best Cupcakes I ever had. The cup cakes should get 5 stars, the brownie I had maybe 3 stars, the disorganized staff is insane, -1 star.",1
"First time I ever had a cannoli was in NJ at Carlos Bakery. Ever since then, it's been my favorite treat. So I get them where ever I can find them. This place is great but they don't fill the cannolis when you order like they did in NJ. They are pre-filled sitting on the shelf. They are still good. I'd of course go back. I want to try the Lobster Tail.",1
"When we arrived the line was fairly long, it moved very quickly though and in no time we were picking out our treats. We ended up with a lobster tail, 3 cookies, a canoli, and a mini chocolate ganache cake. All of it tasted wonderful and surprisingly was only about $22. The staff was AMAZING! My oldest son wanted some cherries, and they went in the back and brought several back for him. It made his day lol. Everyone had a smile on their face and made sure we had everything we needed. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raeganmirickfoodblog.blogspot.com&s=616026dded5efe341860d8a9154d4d7378d28e67af36aa77c5c128d3b2799376"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">raeganmirickfoodblog.blo¦</a>",1
"Carlos bakery is my favorite bakery. I had been dying to go to this place for the longest time. The lines are always very long everytime I had gone. And the place is pretty dang hard to find in the Venetian! I had tried to figure out the best times to go, as sometimes I'd go on a Friday at noon and understandably they are packed. I mean packed. I mean a line like a ride at a theme park. Today however, ahhhh today was different. Today was MY day. Today was the day that I would get to eat baked goods from the great cake boss. I decided who would go on a Wednesday at 4pm? Boom. Only a short line. I looked for about 10 minutes and there was so many decisions. These are big decisions. Not life or death obviously. But big in my mind. So....I got the carrot cake and 2 red velvet cupcakes. It came to about $15 which is expensive but also fair. They put them in a nice little box so I could take it home and enjoy. I don't have much else to say about the place. It is well maintained, clean, and the people are friendly. You can see the workers in the window working on the food. Now how were the baked goods? Delicious! They were among my favorite for the red velvet cupcakes. And the carrot cake was superb as well. Like I . But like I said the lines can be crazy long and finding the place is quite a challenge. So my advice, go there, and if the line is tooooooo long then come back another time. Like say Wednesday around 4pm.",1
Suprized are daughter with this place she loves the show... We enjoyed some of there pastries and they were good...they were nice enough to grab a peace of fondant from the back for my daughter to try... Nice staff...,1
My red velvet wedding cake came from this shop and was the best thing I have tasted ever . It was a perfect end to a perfect day.,1
"I've been wanting to try Carlo's Bakery since they came to Vegas. 5 years of living in Vegas and I finally tried it! I love Cake Boss and I have been waiting to try some of their amazing desserts. And let me tell you- so so good!! Totally worth the wait. It was really busy, but that is the price for amazing desserts. Definitely will be going back! I highly recommend them.",1
"We had the lobster tail, cupcake and towers. My littles had the Oreo and strawberry shortcake towers. My son a lobster tail and cupcake. I think you expect so much after watching buddy on tv all these years that no one could ever live up to the hype. We thought they were good and now we have a story to tell. Luckily we waited just a few minutes. We got there around 9:30 am. FYI buddy opened up a restaurant across from bakery. You can order Canolis and a few other deserts there. You might pay a little more but worth it if the line is long. The restaurant Called buddy v's rocks! Best lasagna and meatballs we've ever had! We also loved their calamari best to 2nd best we ever had. Parmesan chicken yummy too. Free Rosemary bread dipped in olive oil and Parmesan good too. We'll definitely go back. They have a lunch express for $22 Appetizer, main dish and Canolis! Gotta try buddy v's his food is so yummy!",1
"YUM. I tried the cannoli, lobster tail, & crumb cake. To be honest the crumb cake was very very hard like a brick. But the others were very tasty. As for the line we only had to wait about 10 minutes. We came around 4pm on a Saturday, today. The workers were also very friendly and talkative so that was nice. :)",1
"The best part of coming here was the free samples. We wanted cake but there was only 2 of us and the little cake samples were a perfect and satisfying offer. But the REAL. And SERIOUS reason for going there was to try their lobster rolls. Each roll was $5.95 so it adds up. They do not price cheaper of you buy a dozen. We easily spent $70.00. The promo at the time was spend $39.99 and get a signature mug. I give those lobster rolls 10 stars. The cream inside was really good. It's the epitome of a ""cheat day"" item if you are dieting and it was and is WORTH every powdered sugar molecule. Some other items we threw cash at was the pumpkin cheesecake, homemade 'milano' cookies, cannolis, and the American eclair. The items are pricey so I would either keep going back and divide your 'taste-bud-wants'. If you don't want to come back and live far away from a 'cake boss' site (like the one in Vegas)then you should spend nearly $100 and try all you want.",1
"I love Buddy and his family oriented bakery / T.V. Show Cake Boss so naturally I had to go out of my way and stand in a long obnoxious line to get a taste of his pastries. After doing my homework by reading tons of reviews & browsing through pics I came to the conclusion that the only item worth trying would be their Lobster Tail. I was right. Their cookies/biscotti were basic and insanely overpriced at around $17 a pound. The Lobster Tail pastry alone cost $6 for one so I was good with that. The exterior shell was so crispy as in crunchy, not flaky like a croissant but more like it had a nice crunchy bite to it which I loved. Filling consisted of a mixture of Custard, Whipped Cream and Baileys Irish Cream (Irish whiskey and cream based liqueur). It was divine!!! Tasted better the following day when the Baileys flavor was more developed and pronounced. Great stuff! Hope an L.A. location is on its way...",1
"We arrived a little later in the evening and mid week so we didn't have to wait to be attended. They take your order and then you are asked to step aside while they pack it all up. We got a lobster tail, two cannoli's, a sprinkle shortbread cookie, and an Oreo cake cup. Total was $29 something. Not cheap, but I was a huge fan of cake boss so I had to check it out! The pastries were good. To each his own. Okay, I was not wowed, but I will say the cream was very light and yet rich- odd, and my review is based solely on me as a fan of the show.",1
Have had the cannoli on numerous occasions and it is amazing. The wait in line was a little long but that is to be expected.,1
"Came to bring my niece to Carlo's bake shop she's a huge fan of cake boss and since she was in town she asked me to bring her here (she's 11yrs old) it was a little difficult locating the store but managed to find it. There was a long line but not as bad we did take a number and within 10 minutes we were taken care of. My nieces face was wowed with all the beautiful desserts. We ordered a large cannoli, a mini chocolate mousse cake and a mini red velvet cake. The texture of the cakes were very good and very moist and spongy. I loved it and most importantly made a highlight of the day with my niece. Would definitely be back to try out other desserts (:",1
On my very first visit to this Carlos Bakery in Las Vegas inside The Grand Canal Shopes at The Palazzo/The Venetian. The wait to get in was really no wait at all because I came around the slow part of the day. I got a cannoli which I had always wanted to try. It was extremely delicious and fairly priced too. I also purchased A souvenir metal coffee mug. I love the food their and next time im in the area im going to come back for more for sure. If you want awesome desserts that's delicious in your stomach and good on the wallet come to Carlos Bakery the worlds greatest bakery.,1
"I really like the chocolate chip cookies here. Everything else I have tried, (cupcakes, cannoli, cream puff variations) are good but not anything special. I have yet to try their lobster tails, so I will return for those next time I stay at the Venetian. The line can be a bit of the problem here, enough to say that if the wait looks too long, it might hamper your expectations on the dessert themselves.",1
"OMG the desserts are amazing. Check opening times because the line could be an hour wait to get in to purchase baked goods however the wait is worth it. It is right across from Buddy Vs a delicious Italian restaurant. Highly recommended. We got a bunch of cannoli, the lobster creme puff was to DIE for and we got the 7 layer cookies. Yum!",1
"I have been wanting to try Carlos bakery after watching Cake Boss and it lived up to my expectations. My boyfriend and I arrived at the bakery 15 minutes before they closed and we had to wait about twenty minutes to order which wasn't too bad. I got 3 cannolis, 2 regular and 1 chocolate as well as a mini white chocolate tart. The cannolis were the best I have ever eaten, especially the chocolate. I suggest going earlier in the day because they will have more pastries to choose from. The price isn't something to rave about but you're getting quality pastries, not something store bought which I don't mind to pay.",1
This place is a little hard to find and a little small for the amount of people that flood the place. A lot of options to choose from!,1
Awesome place we loved it!! The pastry was excellent the first day but did not travel well. When we got back home it was not worth eating unfortunately!,1
"I had no idea what to expect from this bakery. My wife decorates cakes as gifts and I see her watching ""Cake Boss"" but I have to admit I'm not too familiar with all the TV show stuff surrounding the bakery. The bakery is supposed to be some replication of their Hoboken, NJ bakery. Inside is very clean but small. The wait in line was brutal but given that this place just recently opened and all the hype around it I am not going to complain about the line but it was brutal being a guy who just wanted a cannoli or cookie. This was one of those things I did for my wife and seeing how much fun she and her nieces had made it worth it. We had a few boxes of treats and my wife had a special box made for me so that she and the girls could sample their treats and I could have my own. She knew this outing wasn't my cup of tea so that was thoughtful lol. I had a couple cannolis that were filled fresh in front of us. Thy have some pre-made and also empty cannoli shells so you just have to tell them if you want it filled fresh or not. I think the people who pick the pre-made ones and don't know better to ask for it filled will end up with a soggy mess. I had a carrot cupcake that was moist and tasted good. The lobster tail is out of this world and I can only imagine with the one here being the regular size what the XL version across the way at Buddy V's is like! My cream puff was the best thing next to the lobster tail I just wish it were bigger. I liked everything I had but I did think that it was wierd when my wife showed me the Carlo's mug she purchased. It said ""Hoboken"" on it. WTH? This is Las Vegas! Please get some mugs that actually say Las Vegas on them. It just makes sense!",1
"Be prepared to wait in line and look at the menu while you are waiting in line!!! I had a large cannoli and a hazelnut cream puff... It was my last day in Vegas and I was trying to be good!!! Everything in the glass looks inviting!! Staff was super friendly and speedy, loved that this bakery was at the Venetian which I was also staying at!",1
"We got the brownie, chocolate chip cookie and the strawberry cheesecake. Everything was delicious! Went later at night and there was not a long line at all. It is extremely hard to find if you come in through the Venetian. I would recommend heading in closer to the Palazzo. The ONLY reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because there were no prices listed for anything other than family trays of goodies. Other than that, it was fantastic.",1
"I came here because I am a dessert whore and to see what the hype was about. Yes, it's convenient to rely on others' reviews, but I wanted to experience it personally. What the hell, I was there anyways. Luckily, there was no major line when I walked up. There were so many sweets to choose from. After scanning the display cases, something caught my eye... The Mini Tiramisu!!! There were ladyfingers surrounding the entire tiramisu! Although feeling still a bit skeptical, I knew I was going to regret if I were to walk away from it. After paying, I went up to the room to indulge in this still-questionable delight. As I stuck my fork into it, I was pleasantly surprised. The ladyfingers were uber soft!!! I gingerly but carefully forked all the way down to the bottom of the tiramisu and gave the first bite to my girlfriend. Her big eyes went bug eyes! She promised I will LOVE this tiramisu. After giving my husband a bite, he approved of it also. Now, it was my turn to taste this piece of heaven. OMG it was love at first bite! I started squirming screeching from delight! This was the best tiramisu I've ever had! It was made just the way I like it--very soft ladyfingers and a completely soaked bottom with a not-too-overpowering sweetness all around. I was completely sweetly, madly and deeply hypnotized by this too-good-to-be-true tiramisu. Yes, Buddy surely knows desserts! Now I fully know and acknowledge his amazing creations! It's not just a hype, it's an eye-rolling orgasmic explosion in your mouth! Seconds??? YES PLEASE!!!",1
"Went on a Friday around 9:30 am. Waited in line for about 30-45 mins. to order then waited about another 15 mins. for them to pack my goodies and pay. I ordered the dark chocolate mousse cake, cannoli, lobster tails, and strawberry cheesecake. If I had to rank the goodies I got in order from my favorite being the first, it would have to be dark chocolate mousse cake, lobster tails, strawberry cheesecake and then the cannoli's. If you like dark chocolate like me, you will definitely love the dark chocolate mousse cake. Wish I had me a piece right now.",1
Sweets were great! No line on the day we went (we were there in between lunch and dinner). There were so many choices. They also had various gift items with their name on it. We shared an eclair and cannoli. Both of them were delicious,1
"The shop was beautiful and clean with a very colorful display of many different varieties of goodies. My only qualm was the fact that we had to wait 45 minutes just to get in and order! But the strawberry shortcake, chocolate chip cookies, and cannoli's were amazing!!",1
Carkos Bakery in Vegas! Best cupcake in Vegas!!! Big fans of the show. I highly recommend.,1
"Came here for one thing only: lobster tails. I've been wanting to try these bad boys ever since I saw it on an episode of Cake Boss a few years ago. The hubs and I strategically grabbed a number, checked in for dinner at Buddy V's, got seated, ordered our dinner, then the hubs went to order our lobster tails. How about that for a game plan? The cream was just heavenly; light, fluffy, and not too sweet. The only disappointment was they were out of cannoli's but honestly, I can care less about trying those now that I've been able to experience these beauties.",1
So So good. Carmel Cupcakes and Buttercreame cupcakes no words. I'm not a sweet eater but these were do worth it.,1
"Great service! Great treats! Big fan of the show and I didn't realize they were in Vegas until we started walking around the hotels. Definitely worth a stop! Try the puff pastry, and the cheesecake so good! I like that you can watch them baking from the windows",1
"This place was as good as I had hoped it would be! I have wanted a Lobster tail ever since I saw them on the tv show years ago... my husband brought me to Vegas, and helped me achieve a bucket list! I hope to someday visit the real Carlo's bakery in New Jersey but, this was the next best thing!!",1
Carlos bakery I love you lol. The sweets are amazing. I bought several cupcakes and they were delicious. The line was kind of long but it didn't take long to order. The staff was nice and friendly. They even told us about the bakery getting built and about the cake boss visits. You feel like family. I can't wait to come back.,1
"They were busy, that was to be expected on Mother's Day though. Service was great and the tiramisu and boston cream pies were delisioso! We had Little canolis, macaroons and rainbow cookies. I enjoyed the coffee as well!",1
"Quick, friendly, and extremely organized! There were many treats to select. They had a glass wall in which you can watch the busy bakers. There were plenty of staff members working hard and quickly serving guest. Thanks for a great Experience.",1
We had a lobster tail and hazelnut butter cookies both pretty yummy !I recommend checking it out if your in Vegas .,1
I got a cannoli and it was delicious. My mom was pleased with the lobster tail. My dad on the other hand was not pleased with the prices and wished it was cheaper. In total we paid almost $15 for two cannolis and the lobster tail. While it was a little packed I found it worth it as I used to watch Cake Boss a lot and always wanted to go to one of the bakeries.,1
"Our wait wasn't bad at all...twenty minutes, top. We were a little confused about what to do when we got to the counter as no one greeted us or guided us on what the procedure was, but we ordered a canoli (meh), a red velvet cupcake (ahright, not bad), cream puff (another meh item), a lobster tail (so good!) and the best jam filled cookies we've ever had. Overall impression, clean, homemade tasting, not too sweet but sweet enough, I'd wait in line again type of joint. Especially for the jam cookies.",1
"My husband and I love cake boss so when we saw this place we just HAD to try it. We were not disappointed, the pastries we got were absolutely delicious and delectable. They were sweet and soft, not over baked. And the staff was great, they helped us decide since we didnt know what to choose they have soooo many things!",1
First off if you never had a cannoli this is the place to go! I probably got one of each dessert! I was not disappointed I knew buddy was something else! Mr. Cake Boss should be happy how this store runs the employees were very customer friendly:),1
"The only thing I didn't like was waiting in line. I seriously have no clue why people do not give this 5 stars. I had the Cannoli and the cream inside was amazing! Not too sweet or heavy. I loved the look of the bakery, it also has a viewing window so you can watch them making things as you wait in line. I will go back next time I visit Vegas.",1
"I meant to go to the Bouchen bakery instead,but I couldn't remember which bakery had the best cupcakes.This is where one staff said the only bakery stuff there was.Disappointed now I realize the mistake. I did try the brownie, peanut butter cupcake and an oreo pudding. I loved the brownie.It was so rich and creamy. The cupcake was good too.Liked the frosting lots. Oreo pudding was okay, not worth the money. Not going to come back as the line was too long. I'm headed to the Bouchen next time.",1
This place is amazing!!! The lobster tail was great and so was the cheesecake! To many cry baby's on yelp about waiting in line. It's a known bakery of course there is going to be a wait.,1
"Came for the Cannoli and shockingly they wren't that great! but everything else is spectacular. The cheesecake is perfections and the biscotti mamamia! There's a lot of mouthwatering and deliciously looking items to choose from, been trying two two each time I am there. Definitely a must try when in Las Vegas, just skip the Cannoli and go for anything else! Oh and sometimes there can be a little line so be patient.",1
"Was so excited to finally try the things I've heard about and drooled over for years. AMAZING! Better than I ever imagined and then some. Looking forward to going back again soon. Well worth the short wait in line, and the prices are very reasonable considering the quality. I LOVE IT...IT IS NOW MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BAKERY!",1
"Delicious but expensive. $3.50 for one chocolate chip cookie. Had a cannoli and a cream puff so far, delicious. You pay for Carlos bakery's fame",1
OMG!!! Sugar-Tooth-Heaven!!! As a kid I enjoyed rainbow cake. Italian/American folks know what I am talking about. Carlo's Bake Shop nailed it. The chocolate strawberries are so freaking good.,1
So of course we stopped by since I watch his show on tv and I bake I just had to :) I tried the cannoli and it was nice and fresh and crispy... But flavor was only okay... But then we tried the lobster tail and boy oh boy that was a little bit of heaven in my mouth! It made us go back for 2nds! The only down side is this place isn't cheap... Walked out with a box of goodies and it was $49... So that's a bummer but still worth trying... Oh the strawberry cheesecake is very delicious too,1
"Wow. I can't believe how complacent people are. I loved everything that I bought. Don't believe the reviews until you go and try it for yourself. These ""one star"" and ""two star"" people are just unhappy and miserable people.",1
"Was here at around noon today. I only waited in line about ten minutes for my number to be called. I ordered a lobster tail, a chocolate cannoli, and a regular cannoli. Waited about another five minutes for the cashier. All of my desserts were in the box when I got home. Tried all of them and they were all very good. Thanks.",1
"Yummy!! So many things to choose from. We tried a cookie, brownie, cannoli and a cupcake and all were fresh and delicious!",1
Holy Canoli! And crumb cake! Also loved the cheesecake! Lobster tail didn't do it for me...neither did the carrot cake or red velvet.,1
"We went here for the 1st time as part of our family double date. There was a 45 minute line! People behind us said they stood in line a previous time but didn't get in on time so here they were again. Glad we didn't give up. We tried all these pastries & none failed us (picture will be posted in pink box): strawberry cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake, Tiramisu, cream puff, dark chocolate mouse cake, & large chocolate chip cookie. All were amazing but dark chocolate mousse cake was heavenly!! Even though it was good, I'd skip the cookie because it wasn't worth $4+. Downfall, pricing is steep for diabetes proned baked goods - even though they did good, nothing was too sweet except maybe the cookie. All this came out to $50...I am coming back for the dark chocolate mousse. I read other people's reviews & want to try their lobster tail, cannoli, & crumb cake next!! CAN'T WAIT, going again this weekend!! :-D",1
"Finally got a chance to pick up desserts from Carlos bakery. The oatmeal cookies and Carrot cake were really really good. Buddy, your father would be proud. The line was crazy long but it went fast and it was well worth it. Carlos Bakery is a must.",1
"My 26 year old daughter told me to go here and get a treat for my 50th birthday..I went on aug 13th 2016,I did have to wait in line.got there around 9:30 pm at night. I got me a vanilla cupcake and 1 choc.I though it taste very good.My daughter could not have a treat she can only eat gluten free. I wish they had gluten free. I know Bouchon does but did not know they were only open til 7pm.I would not try canoli.I do not like cream cheese in mind.My aunt is from italy and she does not put cream cheese.She puts pudding in hers. and it taste so much better that way.",1
Amazing! Best deserts and pastries I've ever tried. Have to go back before I leave Vegas.,1
"We were here on a Friday afternoon and thankfully the wait wasn't bad at all, maybe 10-15 minutes max. The employees were nice and helpful and got everything we wanted right away. This was my very first time trying a cannoli and I'm not a big fan of the cream they used but the shell was great, the Napoleon was Ok but the lobster tail was AMAZING! Overall it was good but a bit pricey.",1
"It has been quite a while since I've been wanting to try this bakery for a while, made it here for breakfast, they have really good desserts & the french vanilla coffee came out really good. 3 desserts & 1 coffee did come out to $19 yikes worth every bite though",1
"Wow. There's a reason this guy is the Cake Boss. My girlfriend and me went to Carlo's Bake Shop after attending a show and was surprised to see that the line was minimal, probably because of how late it was. Typically there a long line out the door of folks waiting to experience fine baked good. I had the California Cheesecake which was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had. My girlfriend stocked up on snacks for the remainder of the trip and purchased a strawberry cheesecake, a couple different types of cupcakes and some amazing cookies! Everything was full of flavor, aesthetically pleasing, fairly priced for Vegas, and the customer service was top notch. I will be making a return journey for my more cheesecake when I return to Vegas!",1
"More gluten free options please!! I wanted a cupcake bad and figured with all their cupcake options in the case, one of them had to be GF. They weren't, but as a consolation prize they had a personal cheesecake covered in chocolate that was. It was delicious, not too sweet and not overly rich.",1
"Best cannoli's I've ever had in my life! Also, the lobster tails are to die for. Unbelievably tasty. You will be so happy you came here. Worth the usually long lines. I just really wish they had a place to sit, but that's okay. That's the only negative thing about this place.",1
Maybe it's because I was born and raised in Hoboken and was able to enjoy these pastries with no line before the fame so I may be biased. The pastries fir years have been amazing so I never mind the wait. To me it taste awesome but it's a taste of my childhood and I would wait online to recapture that moment. The line is not that bad for what you get. Lobster tail and cannoli was great!!! Everything there is great!!!!,1
"Best Cannoli I have ever had in my life! And I have searched high and low!! Perfect cream, chips, texture! My kids and I loved how we can watch the bakers and decorators while we waited. And the Cannoli Cake! I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can eat some more!!",1
I love the biscotti it is pricey as this is vegas and tourist attraction. The Biscotti is well worth it though very lovely with a nice cup of coffee.,1
"This place is worth finding! Up an escalator and down a hallway that leads outside is where you'll find Carlo's. Small? Yes, it's very small, but kust the right size to get in and out. A little pricey IMO, but everything was fantastic. I would go again, but i'll leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find my way back to the casino.",1
"Loved the cheesecake, brownie and cupcakes. Omg!!!!! Only downfall they do not have chocolate milk",1
"The line was a little long, but the pastries were good. It is a little pricey but it is Vegas! Great place to visit, but would love to go to the original.",1
What?!!! Not enough words exist to describe the crisp crunchy pastry and fresh creme I just ate. Best of the best. Cant handle it.,1
"I'm a huge bakery nut and this place was AMAZING!. It is located inside the Venetian Hotel and Casino. I visited around 3:00 on a Saturday and the line was pretty long outside the shop, but it was quick, and the shop was efficient in getting orders quickly but still being very friendly. I wanted to order multiple items, but most of the good (because they had frosting) were only good for a few hours our of a refrigerator. The girl taking my order was very friendly and offered to let me pay for all of my items but only take what I was planning on eating, and they would store the rest of my order until the end of the day! Because of this option I was able to order more it me because I didn't have to worry about them going bad before I could eat them. I bout a Lobster tail, a cupcake, and an Ã©clair. All of the items were very good, but the Lobster tail was by far them best! I was very happy with the service, the food, and how timely they were with orders. I would come back here again.",1
Try the hazelnut cream puff. It will knock your socks off. Went on a Tuesday so very short line and live music across the hall at buddy's made the wait fun.,1
"The cookies. The cannolis. The line might be daunting at times, but this is worth the wait. It's clear there is delicate care and attention to detail in their products. Ive heard the ""lobster pastries"" are delicious and I'm gonna have to go back again for this next treat.",1
"Get the lobster tail. Best dessert I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Next to that, the cannolis... Oh my goodness!!! You'll need an intense workout after devouring them but you won't regret it!",1
"First timer at Carlo's Bake Shop. I tried the Cannoli's of course, strawberry tart and a caramel cupcake. All pretty good. It's definitely somewhere to visit while in Vegas.",1
I love watching Cake Boss and was excited when I found out Vegas had this spot! This place is definitely a go to! I got to try a little bit of everything...from the chocolate chip cookies to the apple turnovers to the carrot cupcake! My favorite was definitely the turnover it was so flakey and soft and the carrot cake was moist but it was kind of flavorless...,1
We went there on a Friday at 1pm and there was no line. We ordered two Canolis - a plain one & the chocolate coated one. The Canolis were really yummy and a really good size. I love the cake boss so it gets a 4 star as the crust of the Canolis was beautiful - not sure I would rush back again or line up.,1
"Glad we went a little earlier because by the time we left there was already a line waiting on the side. Didn't like that they took our order then called us back to view everything then call us back to pay for it. Couldn't one girl just get our order and package it while I told them what I wanted then ring us up?? Oh well. But the treats were okay. Not as bad as some of the fellow yelpers kept saying. Had the lobster tail, red velvet cupcake and a flower one. Then two different cream puffs and a few other things I can't remember. Would definitely be back.",1
"Worth the long line and high prices. Crumb cake, carrot cake, and strawberry shortcake were out of this world. The line was about an hour when we went. They need to speed up their process which is why I couldn't give 5 stars. And unfortunately we didn't run into Buddy.",1
"We had to go while in Vegas just to say we've been there. The line took at least 30 minutes to get through but we got some cookies, an eclair, and a Boston cream parfait thing. The cookies were delicious, the other stuff, average. Glad we went tough!",1
"I stopped by on a Saturday mid afternoon. The line was not long. Waited about 30 minutes. yes, the line is not perfect yet. I did grab a ticket first, but then an employee came around with tickets (her number was smaller than mine) because most people do not grab a number. I got a lobster tail, Ã©clair and cannoli. The best was the lobster tail and Ã©clair. The cannoli was OK. I will be back!!! I will try different things - the cheesecake. Next time will have to try the restaurant as well.",1
"We visited this location because of the recommendation from a coworker. But, we ultimately returned a few more times before the end of our stay, because we enjoyed the chocolate chip m&m cookies. I agree that the service is hit and miss - some of the ladies who work here act as if they are barely able to tolerate the tourists.",1
"We definitely beat the rush!! Very satisfied with our service! Magaly was the one taking our order and she was such a sweetie!! We didn't see chocolate covered strawberries (we wanted some to drink with our champagne for our anniversary) and I asked Magaly about it. She said they don't have any to sell separately, but she would check with the baker. She comes back so happy and smiling and told me her baker would make them for us! It's people like her that do their best to satisfy customers that make me wanna come back! Thanks so much!! We haven't even paid yet or tried anything! I was just too excited to brag about Magaly! Keep up the good work, girl!! Thanks so much!! :) :)",1
"I really enjoyed the pastries that we tried but I agree with other reviews that there is NO sense of urgency from the employees! Wait in line to order your pastries then go get in another line to pay for them! Both times we went, the paying line took forever. The cashier seemed to always be M.I.A",1
The best bakery in town. My daughter watched the shows and she couldn't wait to try it!!!,1
"Without a doubt, cannolis are one of my favorite desserts ever. So after driving down the strip during a BUSY edc weekend, I notice buddy's picture at the venetian. My heart dropped. I have been wanting to try his cannolis for the longest time. My boyfriend and I even considered getting it shipped on the website just to try, but I knew deep down it wouldn't be the same. After the long weekend with little to no sleep, I begged my friends if we can stop by so I can live one of my many food dreams and eating that beautiful carlo's bakery cannoli. With two hours before the flight, we quickly walked through the canal shops where we waited in a not too long line. That was the first thing that made me happy. I HATE waiting. We weren't in line for very long, maybe about 20 minutes. It was finally my turn to order and there they were, the cannolis I've been waiting to try all weekend! Knowing I couldn't take them all the way back to California with me, especially in that horrible Vegas heat, I had to settle for two :( I also decided to get a few lobster tails and a piece of crumb cake because I was definitely eyeing those as well. Loved the cannoli and the crumb cake! Haven't tried the lobster tail just yet but judging from the other two, I'm pretty sure I will love it as well. I don't remember the girl's name who helped me but she was very nice and helpful! She was kind of short and had glasses. Made my experience just that better. I can't wait for my Vegas trip to get more!",1
I ordered cannoli and lobster tail... these are the two that you should try when you are at the Strip in Las Vegas... the lobster tail is crazy delicious if you like a cream filled dessert.... way much better than a cream puff.,1
"So I been waiting for a while o check this place out, Im really not a huge bakery fan but I love watching Cake BOss and wanted to see what exactly is the big fuss. I wasnt a fan of the cupcakes but i liked the cannolie but LOVE the LOBSTER TAIL....",1
"I love Cake Boss and made a special trip one evening of our Vegas vacation to visit Carlo's Bake Shop in the Venetian. Giving this place 4 stars for yummy deserts. The evening we went to visit was a Saturday night, the line was long but it moved quickly. There is a window to see them preparing deserts but not much was happening when we were in line. Once we got to the front we choose a bunch of different deserts - a cupcake with a Ace of Spades on it, some butter cookies dipped in chocolate and sprinkles,a chocolate mousse mini cake with ganache, a brownie, a cannoli, a napoleon and a black and white cookie. The icing on the cupcake was yummy, the mini cake, brownie, cannoli and b&w cookie were all tasted. Everything except the b&w cookie was really good. I'm not a fan of that cookie and it is one of their famous treats on the show. Oh well. It was fun and $37 later I was relieved I didn't spend more. They took the order, collected the items and packed them all in boxes tied with string and bagged. I didn't like that they didn't specify what needed to be refrigerated and unfortunately we left it all on the table that night and realized that we needed to throw out some of the perishables the next day without tasting them.",1
"I read quit a few poor reviews but had to try it anyway! It's cake boss! I had a great experience! Great service, no line, friendly staff! Dessert was fantastic! Shared a lobster tail and caramel cupcake!",1
"I am not a fan of the show but wanted to have the taste of real cannoli's once again. Being from the East Coast, I decided to try my luck through the crowds. YEP, it's crowded but this is Vegas. Everything is crowded. Cannoli's: Wonderful! The pastries and brownies: DIVINE. The lobster tails: Amazing. The Nut bars: OH. MY. HEAVENLY. NUTBAR! I have tried so many things from there, and I have not been disappointed once. It is a fantastic addition to Vegas and I hope they open another ""off the strip"" location so I can make them a weekly trip. The staff is all wonderful and attentive. Keep up the good work, guys!",1
"The cookies were mediocre for the looooong wait in line, but the lobster claws and the canolis were amazing! I cannot understand why they do not add more help and at least two more registers. This place is all long waits. Five stars if they figure out a way to speed things up. Three hours is too long.",1
"Carlo's Bakery in Las Vegas was such a neat treat! No, it is not New Jersey, and the place is small, so do not expect tons and tons of variety. For a small shop set up inside the Venitian Hotel shoppes, it was very fun to visit! My favorite baked goods were the eclaires with chocolate on top, and the pecan white puffs! They even sell souvenirs which was the icing on the cake for me! The sweets are not cheap, yet not expensive. Expect to pay about $4.00 for one sweet. You are in Vegas though, almost nothing is cheap! You can watch employees bake pastries while you wait for your sweets to be boxed and bagged! I went there twice during my stay in Vegas and even brought some home with me on my carry on!",1
"Such delicious pastry's. The prices are a little high but are worth it. The cannoli's are to die for and my favorite! Don't be surprised with how busy it is, you need to try it out!",1
"I was here on Monday afternoon I waited in line to try out the cannolis and lobster tails they were AMAZING! As I was placing my order the girl was very nice enough to box it the way I wanted it she had excellent customer service (girl with a tattoos) she recommend the crum cake and the red velvet cupcakes they were also amazing I'm glad she recommend it she called me to checky order I was amazed by how fast it was done and how quickly it was packaged but as my name was called to the register the customer service was not very good my wife and I were so disappointed by the way she treated us very horrible attitude and on top of that she gave me the incorrect change I was $5 dollars short and when I asked her she just rolled her eyes and snatched the money out my hand I believe her name was Jessica or jeniffer, other then that everything was perfect I'll be glad to come back here just as long as I get attended by another cashier who gives the correct change with less attitude",1
Went here Tuesday 9/2 and there was only a short wait. The workers that helped me were very friendly and helpful. Everything I ordered was delicious especially the cannoli and lobster tail!!!!!! I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas!!!!,1
Highly recommend the lobster tail & the cannolis! The items were slightly pricey but you pay for the name & quality. Caution- the line was super long but it was definitely worth it!!,1
I went to this place and it was amazing! I was only in line for 15 minutes and they had samples along the way! I had the strawberry short cake and was the best I've ever had! I would totally recommend this place.,1
"The bakery itself is tiny and overcrowded (which leads to raised expectations ). The staff is quick and friendly (which helps after the inordinately long wait time! ). However, the cakes themselves aren't exceptional . They are good, but given the wait time and the price, ""good "" simply isn't good enough ...",1
"it was great, got a box of goodies and intended on taking them back home for my family to enjoy but for some reason they never made it, we ate them all!",1
"I have been waiting to try this place since my last trip to Vegas. Line or no line I was committed to checking this off of my bucket list. Good thing too because the line was really long and I was in it for over 45 minutes. Fortunately, the hubby was willing to wait, and more fortunately, the line was organized. I just felt bad for the girl managing the line. Since it was separated into 3 sections, she had to keep running back and forth to keep the flow going, guide potential cutters to the back of the line (which was past the bathrooms), and hand out menus and samples. I would just suggest that they also block off the first part of the line leading directly into the bake shop so it is more obvious that people can't just walk in when it's extremely busy. A lot of people coming in from the front didn't even realize that the line was so long, so that caused a little friction between the staff and the customers who had been waiting so long. Anyway, down to the pastries... We ordered the mini cannolis, lobster tails, cupcakes, raspberry rugalach, and m&m cookie. The cheesecakes looked divine, but at $10 a piece I had no trouble passing them up and I think a lot of people felt the same way because they seemed to have an untouched, endless supply. I really wanted to get their 7-layer cookie because they looked so good on that one Cake Boss episode where they made a gigantor tray for a pregnant lady, but I didn't see any. The cannolis were delish. The lobster tails had a crispness unparalleled by any pastry I have ever had, but less cream would have made them perfect. The cupcakes were ok - not sure why they put a walnut on top of their red velvet cupcake (completely unnecessary, and dangerous for someone with a nut allergy who would typically consider this a safe bet). The frosting on their blue snowflake holiday cupcake was just too sweet - I would have liked a whipped cream based frosting. I can't personally speak to the raspberry rugalach because I wanted to save whatever available stomach room I had for the cannolis, but according to my husband, they were pretty good (that's a lot coming from him). The m&m cookie was waaaaaaaaay too sweet. I'd skip it entirely. Even if this is your go-to dessert. Skip it. And don't let your kids eat it. Even if they beg. Service was good - quick and competent. The cashier was really nice and very helpful when I asked for water and additional cream for the coffee we ordered. All in all, I was glad I finally got to try this place. A little overpriced, but that's Vegas for you. If you've been thinking about trying it, just do it. And be sure to order the cannolis!",1
"This place was busy and the service was good, our counter person was good at what he does. He knows the product and how to sell it. We took our goodies back to our room. Everything I had was excellent. The items price wise are in line with the hotels on the strip pastry shops. I would go back again.",1
"I had to check it out when I heard it was coming to Vegas. The line was a bit long but it moved pretty quickly and it has only been open for a few months and it is the strip. The staff has been friendly every time I have gone also. I LOVE the American Napolian pastry. I have driven to the strip just for that. I also like the crumb cake a lot (it reminds me of the kind my grandma used to make). The cannoli and lobster tale were okay but not great (to me) and my son liked their chocolate chip cookies. Yes the prices are a bit higher than you would think but they are handmade, a celebrity bakery, AND it is the strip after all. I have not spent more than $20 there and gotten at least 4-7 things every time which is not that bad when all is considered.",1
I love this place. Wait is long so come before 10 am. The cannolis was good but really didn't care for the lobster tail.,1
"loved it, the wait is long but what do you expect its on the strip, lobster tail cream was awsome, find your favorite and enjoy. Thanks carlo",1
"Delicious cannoli and lobster tail! Long lines, but worth the wait. No where to sit and eat at the bakery, so brought our treats back to the hotel room.",1
"We bought a custom cake for our daughter's 15th birthday, as she has watched the show since its inception. The staff were very helpful, as they prepared the cake for travel, as we were taking it on the plane with use. When we picked it up, the cake was even more beautiful than we imagined. The fondant, flowers, and scrolling were mind-blowing and the edible glitter was a great touch, making the cake sparkle. Unfortunately, after I picked it up and brought it to our hotel room, the custom made fondant #5 of the ""15"" sagged and broke. I was worried that, after I signed the form when I picked it up that products damaged after pick-up can't be returned, they would not be obliging. Nothing could be further from the truth. I got to the stored just as they were closing and the staff stayed late to fix it the best they could as a new one could not be made at that late hour and we had a 6am flight out the next morning! The surprise on my daughter's face when we should up with a Cake Boss cake is something I'll never forget. Upon eating it, all involved agreed it was the best red velvet cake they had ever had.",1
"How exciting that Carlos Bakery is in Las Vegas. We had the Lobster Roll, it was perfect! There is a long wait to get into the Bakery. Don't give up, it is worth the wait.",1
I heard the lines can reach up to 2 hours but i went at about 4 and only waited 40 minutes. They were out of canolis but i ate at his restauraunt right after and they had both the canolis and the lobster tails which were THE BEST IVE HAD. The cupcakes were moist and delicious. 10/10,1
"Cake boss!!!! Very small bakery right across from buddy's restaurant in the Venetian. For being so small it has a good selection of desserts. Prices were very reasonable for these types of desserts. The bakery staff was super friendly and helpful. We went around 730 pm on a wed and they were not too busy. I can imagine though that there are times when this place gets packed. My girlfriend tried the lobster tail and I had the mini white mousse. My dessert was awesome, loved the flavor combination and it was actually enough for 2 maybe even 3 people. The bakery is really cool because you can see the bakers through a big glass window creating awesome desserts. The place smells delicious also! I'll be back!!!",1
"Waited in line not very long maybe 15 minutes. The young man taking orders was very sweet and helpful in his recommendations. We had just eaten a buffet so did not get much but what we had was outstanding!!!!!!! I had a cannoli my son a chocolate covered strawberry, some friends in our party had the creme puffs and cannolis. EVERYTHING was delicious. This place is on the list of HAVE TO GO while in Vegas. They also wrapped it up very nicely in boxes tied with string and bagged!",1
This is a stop you must take if you are in the Venetian! The lobster tails and crumb cake are to die for. It is the best crumb cake I have ever had in my life! The wait time is long but nothing compared to the original location! If you get there early enough the wait time is not bad. I think I was there some time between 11-1 and the wait time was not bad but it got really crowded right after we got there. It is worth it if you are a fan of Cake Boss or just looking for some amazing crumb cake. I highly recommend it. It is also fun to watch the people make the pastries next door while you are waiting for your treats!,1
"My kids are huge fans of Cake Boss so when we were on vacation in Vegas and we saw the billboards with Buddy we knew that we had to stop by. Yes, there was a 20 min wait in line but even the service for that was wonderful. I am disabled and I walk with a cane, when the line tender noticed me he pulled me out of line and offered a chair for me to wait in, most places are not that considerate. The sweats were also wonderful and the girls working the counter were very nice as well as helpful. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas.",1
"I got the Chocolate Strawberry Mousse Tower and it was delicious. I also got a Lobster Tail and a mini Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake for my husband and the kids to try. I'm sure they'll be just as good, based on the reviews on here. The wait was about 1 hr, but I was expecting it, so it didn't seem that long. I'd say it's definitely worth going if you're a fan of the show. I don't know when I'll ever make it to Hoboken to go to the original Carlos.",1
My sister and I went on Tuesday and there was no line. Only maybe 5 ppl infront of us. I got a lobster tail and cannoli. Both were delicious. Loved the lobster tail. My sister got some cookies and the crumb cake. My favorite was the large round raspberry jelly powder sugar cookie she got. So dang good. The jelly was so delicious and fresh. The crumb cake was good but was hard. Overall the pastries were good and just experiencing Carlos Bakery here in Vegas is pretty cool. But for the $$ they charge you could go to a local baker and pay less for the same quality.,1
"Carlo's Bake Shop is an awesome place for a pastry. I wish the location was better in the Venetian/Palazzo shopping area. I actually went here twice during my trip to Las Vegas. First time I ordered the strawberry shortcake, a cannoli, and a triple chocolate cookie. The strawberry shortcake was good. The shortcake was soft, strawberries were fresh, and the cream wasn't too sweet. The cookie had white chocolate chips and the cookie was obviously chocolate. I wasn't a big fan of the cannoli. It was my first time ever having a cannoli. The second time I got a dozen of cookies to bring back home. 3 oatmeal raisins, 3 triple chocolate, 3 chocochips, and 3 m&ms. They have other treats behind the glass and you can see each one clearly over there. The service can be a little better. The lady seemed like she had an attitude and didn't want to be there. Other than that you should at least try this place once.",1
Amazing!!! I love the show Cake Boss and I was super excited to find out about the bakery in Vegas. After reading the reviews here I was hesitant at first because it seemed like I would have a bad experience but I'm so glad I went. First we went on Saturday evening and we only waited approximately 15 minutes and that was total wait. There was not a huge selection but it's a small bakery and I wasn't expecting everything to be there. We ordered the dark chocolate mini cake and a brownie and ooooohhhhh myyyyy wooordddd they were incredible! Worth every penny. So I would have to say if you are influenced by reviews hopefully this helps because my experience was completely how I wanted it to be!,1
"I really enjoyed the red velvet cupcake and my boyfriend had a chocolate cupcake. They were ok! The only thing that didn't make sense was that Carlo's does not serve milk to go with their fabulous desserts. I was told by the staff that I could go downstairs and get milk at Walgreens, which I thought was weird. I'm a local and I don't think I would go back. Milk...it does a dessert good!",1
Completely a fan of this place!!! Everyone is complaining about the wait but we got in and out in less than 10 minutes and we went on a wednesday afternoon!!! For sure worth the wait! The lobster tails are mind blowing!! Cannolis delicious and the cupcakes YUM!!! I would for sure go back and I had been waiting awhile to try some of the cake boss goodies and it turned out to be everything I expected and more! Stop with the bad reviews about the wait because on the show there is always a wait as well!!!,1
My friend keep talking about buying some treats here while our trip in vegas. The line was not as bad we arrived @10pm and we made friends waiting line so made it more fun. My rexommendation to be there as soon they open because they have somethings only in the morning. Bought extra for the family and they loved ut so the wait is totally worth and make sure you take enough $$$$$. When your there you go over bored. I wanted to try everything but they had rub out ofalot things but defenetly going back,1
"So delicious! We ordered cannolis and mousse cake, both were fantastic. I recommend going right after opening or right before closing otherwise the line is very long!",1
"I'm doing a late review.. a year late, but o well. I think Carlo's Bake Shop met all expectations of mine. Being a fan of the show I knew what to expect, long lines and a variety of pastries! The line was actually not too bad for me, it was somewhat long, but this is a tourist spot, so I really didn't mind. I went for the infamous lobster tail and regular canoli which I have never tried, so I really didn't know what they SHOULD taste like. i thought they were good, the lobster tail was flaky on the outside and the creamy inside was super sweet. The canoli was pretty similar in taste for me. The next time I go I won't get the same thing just because there is a lot more sweet goodness I want to try. The people writing all these horrendous reviews about Carlo's Bake Shop need to not be so critical...It's a famous Bake shop so expect a long line and pick and chose wisely, your fault if you don't like what you picked lol all bakers are different so have an open mind, gosh. lol",1
I consider myself a cannoli expert. Seeing the show on tv made me curious and I've wanted to try the baked goods from here for quite some time. The cannoli were some of the best I've had. The lobster tail was light and crispy. I would have given 5 stars but the selection was limited.,1
I was so excited to try the deserts from here after watching there shows so many times.... they did have a lot of options and yes there was a huge line so my rating is mostly on everything the pastries were really good I only got the lobster tail and chocolate cupcake which when I got home I wanted more to bad I live around 700miles away hahaha well anyways I lowered a star because they have BAD service the girl employees are so slow!!! I mean there's a huge line and there's only 3 girls helping with the order and than yhey stop to have a full conversation with each other!!! Like really do u not see the line !!! But besides there bad customer service the deserts are really good,1
"Had to visit the Carlos bakery and went on a sat. Night. The line was as long as a show line in Vegas. Didn't wait but went back at 745am before they opened at 8. Already 10 people in front of me. Wow but worth the wait. Very organized pleasant staff, prices reasonable, best lobster tails I ever had. The cannolis are to die for. Yum I will be back waiting in line before I leave Vegas. Kudos to the manager and to buddy.",1
"I don't get the negative reviews. I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally got the chance. Yes, I waited 40 minutes, but once I got in, the service was fast and smooth. I got a lobster tail, a chocolate canoli and a strawberry tart. I used to hate canoli's, but the one here is AMAZING! So was everything else. I dream of the chocolate cannoli now. I think it's more than worth it and would swim in those chocolate cannolis if I could!",1
The lobster tail was great with the touch of Bailey's. The Napoleon were goid. The seven layer cookies were average barely any taste of almond paste. The Ã©clairs are nothing special. I will reserve my final ratings till I taste a cake. Overall a good place.,1
"I am so glad they brought Carlos Bakery out to Las Vegas! Being a local it's fun to have family friendly places to visit here. Although it is a busy place that is to be expected! We tried a vanilla cupcake, raspberry tarte, a cannoli tower, and cannoli! Everything was so delicious!!! It's a little pricey but a must go to! Ignore the negative reviews, budget in a treat or two and have fun! My husband and I loved it and will be sharing this with our family and friends.",1
"I love this place! My sister and I tried it for the first time about 3 years ago and have been in love ever since! Customer service is always great even if it's busy, they get through the lines pretty quick! I love the rainbow cake and today I tried their lobster tale cookies and cream flavor and it was AMAZING!",1
Holy Cannoli! While visiting the Venetian Casino we decided to grab a sweet and since Cake Boss is a staple we decided why not. It was pretty amazing!,1
"Loved the lobster tail My chocolate covered strawberry was mushy tho, but they were nice enough to refund me.",1
I always get the lobster tail! It's my absolute favorite. The texture is amazing and crispy. The filling is the perfect sweetness. I went today and there was no line. I wish there was tables outside to sit and eat but there's not even a single chair....,1
rainbow cake was so pretty!! The sprinkle cookie was our favorite. It is an absolute must if you are cookie lover. It has a soft cake like texture like nothing else I've tried in the cookie world. Cannoli was tasty and the vanilla cupcake was simply perfection. Make the trip to the Venetian for some desserts!!,1
"Ok, I'm updating my review to 4 stars because we had the cannoli and confetti cake. I'm still giving the rainbow cake, cheesecake and lobster tail low stars, but the cannoli is definitely with the money AND the calories. The confetti cake was a delicious way to welcome in my 40th birthday!",1
"My daughter is a HUGE fan of Buddy Valastro, Carlo's Bakery. We have been to the original location in Hoboken, NJ. I am more of an Ace of Cakes fan, just kidding... I only added this to get my daughter mad, LOL. Quality/Quantity - We have tried everything in his bakery and at his Buddy V's Ristorante. So on this trip we only got: Salted Caramel Lobster Tail - one of his most famous items Chocolate Dipped Cannoli - okay, but another one of his ""must try"" items Lemon Linzer Cookie - nothing special, my daughter just wanted it. Atmosphere - Small take-out location. However, you can see the bakers work through major glass windows. But his Buddy V's Ristorante across the bakery is huge. And he just opened his Pizza Cake Restaurant location at Harrahs Casino. Service - Good Price - $17.18, expensive; but still worth it for his signature items. Owner Suggestion - Congrats on all your success! From all your television shows to being a producer, and of course all 20 bakeries and 3 restaurants with 1500 employees.",1
I honestly almost didn't go here because of the negative reviews. But you know what... I'm glad we decided to see for ourselves. The cake and cannoli were great! The cake wasn't dry as others have said. It was moist and very good. Give Carlo's Bakery a shot if you're at the Venetian!,1
"I was very excited to see Carlo's Bakery at the Venetian Shops. I had visited the original location in Hoboken and was blown away by the desserts and staff. This location was set up similarly in style. There was social distancing being enforced with only a few customers entering the bakery at one time. I walked over to the cases and browsed the goods. A staff member came up to me to take my order. I ordered two cupcakes (both with white cake - one chocolate icing and the other vanilla icing), two chocolate chip cookies, and two brownies. The staff member didn't speak much to me and didn't come off as very friendly. It could have been a busy day even if I arrived at a lull. After ordering, I was instructed to wait for my name to be called for pick up and to pay. I waited about 5 minutes before my name was called. Everything was packaged nicely so that it would survive the 5 minutes walk to my room at The Palazzo. My total was a little less than $30. Which seems a bit pricey for 6 items. When I got back to my room, I couldn't wait to dive right into a cupcake. It was delicious! The cake was moist and the icing was perfect! Just as I remembered from my visit to the Hoboken Bake Shop. After eating the cupcake, I couldn't help myself and I ate a chocolate chip cookie. It was so soft and chocolatey. These cookies were as good as the ones I brought home from The Hoboken Bake Shop for my family to try. Very tasty! The one thing I disliked was the brownie. It tasted off. I normally love fudge brownies, but I couldn't finish this one. It had that dusty chocolatey taste to it. The icing on top was okay. I was a bit disappointed with this dessert. Overall, I love this bakery! The cupcakes and cookies are by far my favorite from both this Vegas shop and the one in Hoboken. Definitely recommend!",1
"You're forewarned to get to the bakery it is a mission from the Venetian guest parking lot. But the walk is worth it. We ordered a cake with Cristina for my mother in law and it came out fantastic! We got some goodies while there and all in all FRESH, DELICIOUS & perfectly sized for us! Major thank yous to Cristina she went above and beyond for us it is greatly appreciated! Thank you Cristina for making the cake even better than we thought! Definitely worth taking a trip into the Venetian for Carlos Bakery Team!",1
"We bought a variety of desserts to share & taste. Everything was delicious! A couple favorites were the lobster tails filled with Irish cream & the rainbow cake. The chocolate covered cannoli was kinda heavy on the chocolate & if we were to order one again we would buy a plain one, not dipped. Just a personal preference, not that it was bad it was just a lot of chocolate overwhelming the cannoli flavor for us. It's not a cheap dessert place but their desserts are to die for & we will return to Carlos' on a future trip to Vegas for a decadent treat. It would be nice if they had any kind of seating available. The few chairs we saw were roped off not to be used. After walking a ton in Vegas it would be nice to be able to sit somewhere & enjoy these desserts, not just have to take them to go. If they had some kind of seating to sit & enjoy the desserts I would give this place a full 5 star rating.",1
"There are many places that you can go to and have the best chocolate cake or have the best in Carrot cake but when you you like something that is very creamy and makes you return for a second time and get a second that is really good and the flavor is the best . There is one thing that many Say is anything you do in Vegas is stays in Vergas but there are so many thing that many people don't know of is there are some really great bakeries that are in the city of Las Vegas and the many restaurants are the best in Dinner .Yes for many if you remember the television series Cake Boss is the one that has created his own restaurants and some of the best baked delicious deserts that have attracted so many across the United States . Yes the many deserts that you see his stores make and the colorful cakes can make one say its a wonderland of fine cakes and deserts and the many deserts are of the New York style deserts . When I had went to Vegas that I wanted to see what Carlos was about the many people and yet the bakery looked like just another bakery and the customers were just the ones that were getting things to take back home to there many states . The many deserts that were at Carlos had to be the great grouping and the many fruity flavors that came out of Carlos Bakery I could tell the staff there had done many cakes and they were getting things ready for more to be put out .The many cakes they have there are the best in town and the many Italian flavors you find the multi colored cakes that have the best fruit flavors , and the grand cakes the carrot cake and the Red Velvet Cakes that have real cream cheese frosting . At the Venetian Hotel you can see the Gondaleirs that steer the long boats that you can take a ride in with your wife or wife to be there are so many that love the Venetian . With Carlos Bakery and the Restaurant that is close by you can the best Italian Dinner that you have ever tasted and still have room for desert . Yes the Venetian is one of the best and with the great place of Carlos you get to sit have great cake or baked good that is pure Italian .",1
Yummy cake and cannolis! Located inside the Venetian hotel! They do not have seating so it's a grab and go kind of place. Lots of variety! It definitely gets crowded so try to arrive early or not at peak times! It is expensive but worth the cost.,1
"I've always wanted to try his pastries since I've heard so many things about it but I've always been to lazy to try to find it lol. Embarrassed to say this cause I've always stayed at palazzo/Venetian as a visitor to resident. I had to wait in line but they had an efficient system going on so the wait wasn't too bad. Let me just start by saying EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD! Like I wanted to get everything but I knew it was going to be very expensive as no prices were marked, it's like order what looks good then surprise! I ended up getting 2 lobster tails, 2 cannolis, and a strawberry cheesecake. The lobster tails were AMAZING. They were crispy and perfect, even when I ate it around 5 hours after buying them. I liked that they weren't too sweet and even my mom loved them. I am definitely going to buy more of those when I go back. The cannolis on the other hand weren't that good. I ended up only eating half of one and gave the other one away. I was disappointed in them and wish I had ordered more lobster tails instead. The cheesecake was expensive like almost $12 and it was so small. It was pretty good though, there's not much crust or anything like Cheesecake Factory ones but more like just the cheesecake part. If you're a cheesecake fan I definitely recommend. Overall I'd definitely go back for more lobster tails. I'd highly recommend you get some if you stop by! The bakery is pretty pricey but if it's good, it's worth it!",1
"I love EVERYTHING here ... literally, There's all kinds of yummy desserts here such as cookies and cakes & my personal favorite is the rainbow cake it's DELICIOUS Every time I visit Las Vegas I have to make a stop here just for that rainbow cake!! I usually buy one slice of it & then regret why I didn't buy 2 But the good thing is, that it's a giant slice and serves me twice!!!!! Yaayyy",1
"I've loved the show so I visited the last two times I was in Vegas. The service is always great! The store is clean and decorated in a bright, warm manner. I had cannoli last time. It was fabulous. This time, my friend enjoyed a rainbow slice and I enjoyed this delectable display of sweetness. I was only able to eat half. It was topped with apple pie, with the pumpkin pie in the middle and pecan pie as base. Then, there are white cake slices in between. It's heaven in dessert form. The pumpkin was creamy perfection. The pecan pie was excellent. And the apple pie just added the extra touch of sweetness! Of course, the white cake was fantastic. You must stop in when you're in Vegas!",1
Everyone was very kind here. It was very organized. I loved the strawberries and the cheesecake. The fudge cake was alright though to me as well as the cannoli.,1
I tried the red velvet & vanilla sprinkles. They both were delicious but I prefer the vanilla. The employees were really polite.,1
I love bakeries and this one was delicious. I've been a couple times. Previously had the cannoli which I sadly didn't love. This time had a lobster tail which was flaky and creamy custard. The fudge brownie was so soft and fudgy. My kind of brownie. And my kiddo loved his Oreo cupcake. Service was quick and my kids liked watching the people make the cakes and cookies,1
Found this gem in the Venetian. Amazing amazing amazing!! We got a slice of the rainbow cake and it was the perfect balance of cake and icing. We also ordered two lobster tails. I wish we ate them right away. We waited a tad too long to eat them and they were a bit hard. Taste was there though... you know that it's the most popular item they have when there were only a few left on the tray. Hehe!,1
"Ventured out to the Grand Canal Shops to eat here at Carlos. This bakery is top notch when it comes to pastries. I had a lobster and cream craving that came over me. I was able to soothe it here with a lobster tail pastry. The bakery is so cute with an old world type feel, I believe that the store having red brick delivers this to the guest. The ambiance of the bakery is a positive excitement but fast paced. The guest specialist that assisted me was very welcoming and so upbeat. This most excellent specialist was named Jasmine. She wrapped both of the pastries that I purchased in a cute little box and with a red and white ribbon on it. The gift wrapping is extra and did not even have to pay extra for it. The cashier that rang my order was Aleena. She was also pleasant and professional. The process was smooth and painless. I order as I said before the Lobster Tail which was so great. The lobster flavor was perfect and oh so good. This Mousse Puff with Chocolate was talking to me through the glass to so I decided to try that as well. The puff was great but the chocolate was so creamy. I decided to mix the chocolate cream and the lobster tails creme together and it was a delicious black and white delight.",1
White chocolate mousse cake and carrot cake were delicious! The white chocolate interior was so creamy like cheesecake with a cake base. Carrot cake was moist and balance of spice.,1
I have loved watching Cake Boss and was excited to try this place in Vegas. The cannaoli was amazing. Love the selection and it was really easy to get in and order.,1
"I do enjoy Carlos bakery however it seems everytime I visit they have less variety that's why 4 stars and not 5. I remember the first time I visited they had danishes and smaller bites today they had cake slices, cheesecakes, cupcakes, lobster tails which seem smaller and cannolis.",1
"Had to, just had to, when you are in The Venetian you have to go to Carlo's Bakery. My daughters are in town and we told them about the bakery...had to go. They got carrot cake, confetti cake, cannoli and cheesecake. Carrot cake, according to my daughter is amazing",1
Who doesn't love an occasional sweet treat after winning or losing! Located inside the Venetian Carlos bakery is an open kitchen where you can see the action and pickup a cookie or baked delight to go. Even in the afternoon they offer plenty to choose from. My favorite at that time were the cannolis. Carlos bakery worth the stop.,1
The bakery was amazing! Loved the Strawberry Shortcake I got for my birthday and the Cheesecake I got for my mom were beyond delicious!!,1
"Would recommend getting the Hoboken Special as it contains most of the small pastries really signature to the Cake Boss show (cannoli, lobster tails, and the rainbow cake as slices). The lobster tail pastry is very similar to the Italian sfogliatella pastry, but is unique to New York and filled with French cream instead of ricotta cheese. Though I also REALLY loved the mini cheesecakes and was really happy about the variety of lobster tail flavors. Also, if you get a bigger order, double-check you got anything before leaving. Would recommend eating the lobster tails fresh. They're still good overnight in the fridge, but it's NOTHING compared to when you first get them. XD For those not as familiar, Carlo's Bakery is the Italian bakery featured on the Cake Boss show. They're based in Hoboken where the original bakery is, but now have locations all over the US and some in Canada. For those from California, they have a location in Santa Monica. This Las Vegas bakery location in The Venetian (so free parking) also faces their sister restaurant (Buddy V's Ristorante, different from Pizza Cake By Buddy Valastro that's down the Strip) and supplies the various Cake Boss ""ATMs"" (vending machines) where you can get fresh slices of the rainbow cake. XD If you're there when it's busy, you'll probably see employees with ordering pads taking orders as far down the line as they can. We kind of jumped the gun and ordered early on, but I would advise against doing so as there are more items up front near the register that you might want. Specifically, I wanted to get an additional lobster tail. They'll let you add it to your order but with how busy things get, things sometimes slip. In our case, since our whole order was in one taped-up box, we didn't realize we were charged for (but missing) the additional lobster tail. They were great about that though. We called ahead, they checked their records, and recognized us when we went back to get that pastry. And it was SO worth it. We ended up going back a couple of times while we were in Vegas, just kept coming back. Overall, would definitely recommend, they're so much fun!",1
"If you have a sweet tooth and are looking for a huge selection of delicious desserts, definately go check out this unique bakery!!!",1
"Ordered a 6"" cake, lobster tails, and cannolis. I don't know if I'd spend so much on a cake again, it was good but probably not gonna be something I'll need to have again. Lobster tails were ok. But the cannolis are very good. Even the next day still delicious.",1
"Back home on the East Coast, I have been consistently unwilling to wait in the LONG LONG lines that are always present to get into Carlo's Bakery! This time however, was early in the morning, inside of the Venetian Resort and there was NO line. It was a great opportunity to order a coffee and a cannoli and sit in the piazza, under a fake Venetian sky, eating my CB breakfast. Cannoli was solid! Thanks Cake Boss!",1
"I've been wanting to try this place for the last 3 years, my first visit the line was about an hour long and I didn't want to wait but this time I was waiting no matter what! I absolutely love Cake Boss and every time I watch it I'm always drooling over the cakes and desserts so when I found out he had a bakery in Vegas I knew I had to try it out. The line was pretty long when we got here, I think we waited 30-40 minutes but it was definitely worth it. The bakery is very small and they have a few people taking orders but only two cashiers so this could be why the line takes so long. They have about 4 cases full of yummy desserts, they have a variety of cupcakes, cakes and cookies. Of course they have cannolis, their famous ""lobster tail"" pastries among other delectables. I ordered the Salted Caramel Lobster Tail and Cannoli Cake Tower, then we ordered a half a dozen cupcakes to taste. The lobster tail was very good, the saltiness complimented the sweetness of the cream inside and the caramel so it wasn't overly sweet and the pastry was nice and flaky. The cannoli cake tower was so good, there was a thin layer of cake at the bottom with a nice thick layer of cannoli filling in the middle, another thin layer of cake then whipped cream on top. It really didn't need the whipped cream and I wish there was one more layer of cake so everything balanced out but it was still delicious. I would definitely get that again. I also had the salted caramel cupcake and it was very good, the cake was nice and moist, the frosting was light and not to thick, the cupcake was good overall and it wasn't too sweet I was really surprised. I'm glad I was finally able to try this place and it was worth it, I wouldn't come here all the time while in Vegas one because of the line and two they are quite pricey. Expect to spend $50 if you get more than 3 or 4 items.",1
Solid cake. They have it all ready to go and it travels well. My family was not disappointed when I walked in with slices for them!,1
"I've been to a few of Buddy's bakery locations across the country, EXCEPT for the original location (beside the point). I get a lobster tail every time. It's crispy and the filling is delicious. What I enjoy most about the lobster tail and some of his other baked goods, is that it isn't too sweet. All the aspects of the pastry are allowed to shine. There's really not much I can say here that will sway most people's opinion of this establishment and the chain of bakeries overall. I'm a fan of this location and I can really only recommend the Lobster tail and the Cannoli, because those are the only things I have tried.",1
"Today's snack was on the Cake Boss, Buddy V ;) While the desserts my husband and I tried were all very delightful, I found that they were a bit too sweet. We had such a sugar rush after. All of the employees were very nice and helpful!",1
My wife and I have been watching the tv show featuring these products and finally went to the Venetian Hotel to try them. We bought two cannoli's that were soft and extremely tasteful. The cannoli cups were filled with cheesecake that was delicious and beyond all our expectations. Don't listen to the negative reviews on these delicious products.,1
"Love the amazing and beautiful variety of treats at Carlo's Bakery. Most are almost too lovely to eat, but who can resist! The treats are amazing and very tasty, as well. Want to also mention the staff, all very friendly, fun and make the trip even more enjoyable! Going to Carlo's should be part of every Vegas vacation! Warning: It's delicious!",1
"Carlo's Bakery From the Hoboken New Jersey original location to the Las Vegas Strip, good bake goods with their famous canoli. I would prefer and highly recommend the Lobster Tails bakes treats, order with Regular, Chocolate, Cookies and Cream filling which are nice and crispy outside and delicious creme filling. Souvenirs and many items to take back as treats for yourself or others",1
"Got a few cupcakes, the rainbow cake was good. The line runs quick. Similar to In N Out there's a order person taking your order and while you wait you can see the workers making cakes and what not. Across the way there's a restaurant of the same, we didnt try the food there but it looked like a place to visit in the future.",1
Been to Carl's bakery in New Jersey grew up on Carl's bakery and now they're on Vegas in the strip I go there for my cannolis my chocolate cake and different pastries depending on what we need the perfect pick me up for breakfast as well as a snack and while you're on the strip amazing customer service,1
"Great baked goods, but overpriced. Not the best pastries but it was a great experience.",1
I was so excited to try this place out. Big fan of Buddy V. I had the famous Cannoli. I also had the butter cream rainbow cake & the chocolate fudge cake. The rainbow cake was very pretty but dry. The chocolate cake was super tasty and rich.,1
"Love the vending machine with a decent selection of cakes for almost $9 each slice. We chose the red velvet cake, came out cold and good flavor but the cake was on the slightly dry side is all but a huge slice was given.",1
"There isn't super high reviews on this page about Carlos Bakery however I was very excited to try and I wasn't disappointed. We got cannoli cheesecake, 2 cannolis, and Red Velvet cake. The cannoli cheesecake was good, the cannolis were alright (probably wouldn't go for those again), however that red velvet cake was AMAZING! Both my husband and I loved it. I felt it was one of my favorite cakes I had ever gotten. It was out of this world amazing! The service was pretty quick and friendly! I'd go back to try some more cakes I think the cakes are the way to go here.",1
"Every time I visited Las Vegas, the line for Carlos Bakery was always way too long, but in my most recent trip, I had a chance to finally try some desserts. Located in Venetian, the bakery itself is quite small. I ordered some sugar cookies, a slice of cake, and a cannoli set ($21). The cookies and cake was nothing special, but the cannolis were absolutely delicious! They recommended that I try the chocolate dipped cannoli, which just added more sweetness to my experience.",1
"I was sad to see the poor reviews for Carlos bakery this is the one place I always make sure to stop at when I have a sweet tooth and am in Vegas. I always order the original cannolis. They are alittle pricey, but you are getting a quality dessert and are in Vegas so what is really cheap (nothing good). I have paid way more for bad cannolis then I have good ones and I have to say I absolutely love the cannolis here and always stop no matter how far away I am on the strip to Carlos. I have brought all of my friends here and I can't rave about this place enough. It is always busy and is such a cute place to stop and look at. The staff is friendly and helpful and even if you aren't a huge sweet person I think the cannoli is the right amount of sweet it's not too sweet and not not sweet enough.",1
"Cannoli was very close to #caffepalermo NYC no Vegas Cigar. Final Grade : A. The best cannoli in a long time. Italy is my #1, Caffepalermo #2 and now #3 Carlo's Bakery. Congrats. If visiting Vegas and you love cannoli's like me, this is it.",1
The best milk chocolate covered strawberries I have ever eaten!! Chocolate was semi-sweet and creamy. Strawberries were extremely fresh and juicy. Couldn't have asked for anything better to end the night. Thank you Buddy!,1
"This place can have quite a long line. But luckily I caught it at a great time. We went yesterday around 3p, the Thursday before Christmas. The line was short and things moved pretty fast. I picked up two treats for mom and me to share. One Chocolate Hazelnut Lobster Tail - the Pastry on the outside had quite a Crunch, but the inside was nice and soft thanks to the glorious Hazelnut Custard! It also had a thick drizzle of Nutella on top. I have to say I wish they hadn't automatically packaged it because the wrapping paper ended up getting more of that Nutella than my stomach did. Our second treat was unmarked, so I'm not sure of the name. It looked like a big, glossy, chocolate cookie. I'm pretty sure it was some kind of meringue because of the light, chewy texture and it's shiny exterior. It only had nuts inside and I have to say I would've preferred chocolate chips. But it was yummy! Next time I'd love to try a cannoli!",1
So I've always wanted to try his cakes since watching TLC. I also ordered a carrot cake and strawberry cheesecake. The line for the bakery wasn't that long but was a limit during Covid -19. I was in and out. They had all the options out in the case and once done ordering they went and prepped your order. It is definitely a must try. Cake was good and moist and not too sweet.,1
"I used to watch Cake Boss pretty casually, so it was exiting to get to visit one of his locations. Inside the Venetian, you'll find Carlo's Bakery, and you'll know when you've found it because there will be a line out the door! But don't let that scare you - Although the line looked long, they get through everyone quickly and we probably didn't even wait more than 15 minutes. While you're in line, there's a huge window where you can watch the pastry chefs create desserts, it definitely helped kill the time! There are so many different options to choose from, and I just wanted something small so I tried one of the cannolis... It was fantastic! Also pretty huge for just one! The staff here are very friendly and efficient, too. Even though it might seem like a tourist trap, it's still a fun place to visit if you've watched the show.",1
Came here during the weekend and there was quite a few people in line. The line went fairly quick. I had high expectations for this placing watching the show. I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the cakes were. I was expecting it to be overly sweet but it was just right. I tried the canolis but it wasn't my cup of tea.,1
"What could be better than scrumptious pastries inspired by Buddy?!? Not much that I can think of. Carlo's has all the amazing treats featured on his show and they all taste incredible. The bakery is small and a shell of his real bakery in Jersey, but it gets the point across. Every time I go I am greeted immediately by a friendly bakery employee and order whatever I want from the case. They are very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting you with your sugar cravings. It is definitely expensive, but it's expected. Once you order you pay and wait for them to beautifully package it all up. You can get anything from cakes and cookies to lobster tails and cannolis and if you want a souvenir to last you can even buy memorabilia. I haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy, though my favorites are the butter cookies, linzer cookies, pecan shortbread covered in chocolate, and the almond coconut cookies with chocolate on top. Do yourself a favor, go to Carlo's and indulge in some sweat treats...you're in Vegas after all!!!",1
Got the 5 pack of cannolis. And man can I say they were sweet. Definitely could only eat one. But they were delicious. Fast service and decently priced.,1
"If you're like me and can't easily get to Hoboken, New Jersey for Buddy's original bakery, at the very least you must try his location in Las Vegas! You feel like a kid in a candy shop. Displays filled with all the sweet cakes, rolls & cookies you can imagine. Get at least 5 lobster tails because you're going to want at least 2 for now, 2 for later and 1 to share (if you're into that, otherwise it's all you)! There's no actual lobster in this pastry, the name comes from the lobster-tail shape. Paper-thin layers of dough with a satisfying crunch filled with gobs of sweet cream, topped with chocolatey hazelnut drizzle. Enjoy!",1
"Every time I come to Vegas I always stop by Carlo's Bakery I love their brownies. I stopped in around Christmas time and unfortunately I didn't see any brownies in the case. When it was my turn to order I asked about them. The lady said they didn't have any, but then a baker showed up with some goodies to put in the case and overheard us. She said they had some in the back that just needed to be frosted and offered to frost them if I was willing to wait She literally made my day I love those things. I also tried this time one of their lobster tails and it was great - my husband even liked that and he is not a fan of sweets.",1
"Upon arrival you can see into the bake shop from a window. It's pretty awesome when a bakery lets you view what goes down! We didn't want to order a whole lot because we were just about to get lunch. We got a chocolate dipped strawberry(so juicy and the chocolate didn't crumble!) and a fondant sugar cookie(perfect amount of fondant) next time I'm going to get a lobster tail for sure! Pros: -lots of variety of cookies, lobster tails, donuts, pastries -Taste was on point -Easy to get in and out -You can watch the bakers -Cakes are on display Cons: -The people working there seemed confused, we stood there waiting for a few minutes before someone finally asked to help us -People seemed to not understand where the line formed. We kept getting cut off and crowded",1
"Selection is super limited to a handful of items, but do yourself a favor a grab a million of the lobster tails yummy goodness--HELLO!!! The whole time I'm eating those darn little things I kept saying, ""this is interesting,"" which is a compliment to the baker! I love creamy desserts--add whipped cream, French cream, mascarpone and I instantly fall in love but man, these little lobster tails had me crunching away! Is it a philo dough over a croissant??? You bite into these little heavenly jewels, and you get this flaky crunch, then soft crescent, then light French cream. I mean who knew something so simple could just make you want to dance a happy dance???? if y'all know me, you know I can't order one thing in a bakery, so we added cheesecake, every flavor lobster tail, and a strawberry shortcake slice. Cheesecake was super awesome amazing. I don't like cheesecake ordinarily, but they were so pretty and petit, I had to try!!! It's a bold bakery that offers mini cheesecakes with no crust and a simple strawberry on top--hot damn it was good!!! Although I enjoyed the strawberry shortcake--I prefer a chiffon cake (from Candlelight Bakery) over a sponge. The lightness of the cream and tartness of fresh strawberries just always seem to go better with the airiness of a chiffon...all in all, the star of this visit were the lobster tails!! going back today before we leave Vegas to grab a box!!!",1
"I'm a huge fan of the Cake Boss and when I found out I could visit his bakery while in Vegas, I knew I needed to! The location is inside the grand canal shoppes inside the Venetian. There are plenty of signs to help direct you. When I arrived, there wasn't a line and I was able to put in my order right away. I ordered an Oreo lobster tail, a fondant cookie and a chocolate cannoli. The girl took my order and then asked me to wait for a bit while they packaged it. My name was called, I paid and I was on my way. Super quick service! Let me tell you...the lobster tail was delicious! The pastry was crunchy, flaky and the filling was so creamy, light and fluffy! It was pure perfection. And the cannoli was the best I've had. The filling was so tasty and paired well with the cannoli shell. The ricotta filling had just the right flavor of cinnamon and a few chocolate chips inside was just right. I have no way to describe them other than by saying they were decedent. I think that's it. Even the cookie was soft, flaky and the fondant was smooth as silk. Wowza! I'm so glad I was able to visit and try a few sweet treats.",1
Cannoli was average. Not what we are used to from Arthur Avenue in The Bronx. However the sfogliatella pastry was absolutely perfect. Staff was very nice and helpful!,1
"We went with the chocolate cake from the machine at Rio, and it was pretty darned good! Large piece, plenty to share! Give it a try.",1
"This review is based on presentation only as we didn't buy here today. This is The Valastro's bakery in the Venetian Palazzo - across the hall from their Buddy V's restaurant. This is a cute bakery split into 2 sections. One for preparation and one for baked goods sales. We passed on buying as we planned to eat dinner Buddy V's later and order dessert there (which we did and OMG - the Italian Birthday Cake!). This all said, if your looking for a sweet baked item, try this place.",1
"very expensive. i got like 4 things it was $30. wtf. and they want a tip. everything looks and tastes soo yummy. i got a cannoli, lobster claw, cannoli cheesecake, rainbow cookie. i wish the hotels would have actual mini fridges we could use to buy items. these celebrity restaurants are all the rage everywhere in vegas",1
"I've been to this bakery a couple of times. The location is what keeps me from frequenting it more; it's not convenient for me. The selection is great. Everything we've ever tried was very very good. The prices are okay. I really enjoy viewing the small kitchen area when someone is in there preparing desserts. There is typically a line and luckily the few times we've been there it wasn't too much of a wait. Staff have been friendly and efficient. The canollis were completely filled; no hidden gap in the middle! Not too rich so it was easy to eat a whole one and not share; mine! I've tried the famous 'lobster tail' which was good. Overall, the store decor and goods are above par, but the location means I rarely get here.",1
For those who ever watched Cake Boss on TLC or other channels but never made it up to Hoboken NJ to try it out. This place is great. Same great treats with a little Vegas price.,1
"I ordered several baked goodies from the famous Carlos Bakery through Goldbelly. My initial experience was Carlos Bakery Las Vegas and it was everything my carb loving heart desired. The Frozen Goldbelly rainbow cake, lobster tails and cannolis were all delivered in pristine condition. After careful following of instructions- the cake was as expected- soft, sweet and perfect. I have ordered both the individual slices and the whole cake- both are absolutely worth it. The Cannolis as well were magical. I don't know what they're doing to these but they are amazing. Crispy and creamy all at the same time. I ate several and still wanted more. Now the Lobster tail I would recommend having at the bakery. They are an experience and need to be eaten fresh. They were much smaller and not the foodgasmic experience I had at the bakery in Vegas. Overall, it is a lot of hype and depending on what you like and what is fresh (bakery vs Goldbelly) it can be said there is something carbtastic for everyone.",1
"The prices were quite steep for this kind of place. We got: cherry cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, lobster tail, chocolate moose and some sort of strawberry eclair. The cherry was good minus we had a pit in one of the cherries... everything was pretty good but we must be super spoiled with Oakmont Bakery in Pittsburgh, PA because nothing compares to it. Still, all in all, a good bakery but definitely not our favorite!",1
Great stuff coming from someone who prefers savory to sweet...I have stopped here on all 3 times I have been here and I will stop here next time again.,1
We got the dulce de leche lobster tail. It did not disappoint. Tons of filling and great flavor. We tried a chocolate dipped cannoli which added a new dimension to the cannoli experience.,1
"I could embarrass myself silly in this place. Yeah I'm a fan of bakeries and patisseries. I'm a home baker and love all things chocolate (dark is the best...milk chocolate doesn't count. Boring.) and any dessert that has cream cheese as an ingredient. My friend and I picked three items to share and they were amazing. No complaints. None. The lobster tail was my favorite. I thought it would be the chocolate mousse filled cake or the cannoli. Nope, nothing could hold a candle to that lobster tail.",1
"WOOOOOOOOW! Is all I can say after having the Hazelnut cream puff. I thought I would never say this, but forget the cannoli and go straight for the cream puffs (hazelnut to be precise!) I died and went to heaven when I entered Carlo's Bakery at the Venetian. I was a fan of Cake Boss on tv, so visiting here during my trip to Vegas was a MUST! It's REALLY hard to find once you're inside the Venetian. I had to ask ten people. It's literally right next to the walgreens, so if there is an entrance near there or through Walgreens, take that route! Don't be like me and run around the Venetian like a chicken with its head cut off! One thing that I am sad about, they forgot to put the red tote bag I purchased in my order! I only realized after I got home... oh well!",1
"This was an amazing experience. All the deserts we tried were delicious. We had the lobster classic, chocolate cake, vanilla cupcake and strawberry cheesecake. It's a must visit.",1
"I have been the Vegas many times and every time we went by Carlos Bakery there was a huge line and even though I love sweets I couldn't stomach the line. Since we are staying at the Venetian it is now just a 5 minute walk away. This is a Thursday night and the wait was 10 minutes. We tried a little of everything and it was all very yummy. They have a lobster claw which is a cream filled pastry and it was great. I also tried the chocolate filled cream puff, the cannoli and two different cupcakes. Everything was fresh and delicious. They wrap everything up for you in a nice box with a gift-like presentation, very classy. The price point is such that everyone can afford to try ""something"" as most of the items are in the $3 to $5 each and I paid $11.00 for a chili dog earlier so in comparison this place is a deal. I still have 3 more days here in and I am certain I will be stopping by again to try some other delightful goodness. Update. I'm back several months later and this place is still rocking the sweets!! Make sure to add this to your list of must do's in Vegas! Enjoy!",1
"2nd time ordering the cannoli's, their delicious and great priced! Make sure to sign up for their rewards, you'll receive free items when accumulating points. Plus they offer military discount!",1
"I always come here when I'm at The Venetian Hotel. The last time I came here was on a Sunday, 03/20/22 before 9pm and there was only one guest ahead of me. The cannolis is a must, not too sweet, crunchy and my go to. We got the cheesecake which was a good size portion and tasted good as well. If you like cake, try the confetti cake and red velvet cake, they are delish.",1
"I am a huge fan of cooking and baking shows and loved watching Cake Boss so when I saw there was a Carlos Bakery here, I knew I had to stop in. After reading he reviews on here, I wasn't so sure it would be worth the stop or the money but I'm glad I came anyways. The bakery is actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be. There was also a long line but it moved fairly quickly. I ordered all 4 lobster tail flavors because that seemed to be very popular amongst the yelp reviews. Of course I got the cannolis, one regular and one chocolate dipped. And one slice of red velvet because that's my favorite flavor. Total was about $45. The staff were all nice and helpful. I had a piece of each cannoli and I don't have much to compare it to so I thought it was really good. I prefer the original over the chocolate dipped one. The lobster tails were good. I wasn't expecting such a crunchy exterior but it definitely added texture to the soft cream inside. The red velvet was great. The cake was moist and the frosting had a nice flavor and consistency. I thought it would be overly sweet but it was very balanced. If I lived in the area, I wouldn't go here often to be honest. But it is definitely worth a stop if you're visiting!",1
"I've always been a fan of Cake Boss and Buddy's family. I've been to the original bakery in Jersey and I've actually met most of his family, including him. I have to say I am really impressed with the selection at this bakery in the Venetian! I loved my lobster tail, especially how crunchy and creamy it was. I got a cookies and cream cupcake which I liked as well. I would definitely recommend going, especially since they have a very small line compared to their bakery in Jersey.",1
wow the food is so amazing here. I know this won't see the business owners eyes but the cannoli's are awesome. I wanted to get a box of 5 and instead I got three because I could not mix and match so that was a few dollars they didn't make and I wonder how many times that happens a day. Everything was yummy especially the lemon custard lobster tail. It was awesome to see my childhood tv show come to life.,1
"Love this place! My mom and I go every time we are in Vegas! Usually not long of a wait and the pastries are always up to par! I recommend the Rasberry linger cookie and the lobster tail, some of the best pastries I have ever had!",1
The rainbow cake is THE BEST item to get! Followed by the cookies and cream lobster tail! I've been here several times and have always had great customer service. Sometimes there can be a line up but they tend to move fast. I Always stop by here when I'm visiting Las Vegas.,1
"I've been here twice now; once last year and I ordered a few cannolis which were to DIE for, and I also got their rainbow cake with vanilla icing in single slices. I enjoyed it so much that I thought that I'd get one of the already made cakes they have ready for purchase for my mother in law's birthday. The cake was just 'ok' this last time (in January '21) it wasn't as moist as I remembered.. but I'm sure that could be due to it being one of the ready made cakes.. I'm not 100% sure. All in all, I still quite enjoy this place and their many desserts. OH!! they also have yummy iced coffee.",1
My first time coming here and I was super excited to try some sweets. The line was super long but that wasn't a surprise. Went by super fast. The customer service was great. There cakes were good very moist nothing I thought really special didn't really like the red velvet idk just to much cream cheese for me. The sprinkle cake was good as well. The cakes didn't really give me like a wow omg yes they are so bomb worth a try. Oh yes and the prices are unbelievable. Very affordable!!!,1
"We picked up some desserts after early dinner. They have a lot of different ones to choose from, but my kid wanted a rainbow cake which could be seen everywhere in Vegas (they sold it on a machine at the pizza cake as well), I just went for their class lobster tail. I love my lobster tail; it's so crispy and not overly sweet. Desserts are not too cheap, for 2 items, I spent 15 dollars here, but hey you are in Vegas!",1
"The Lobster tail and strawberry shortcake...omg my mouth is watering just thinking about these.... ahhhhhhh. My cousin Keane, his wife Adriana, my bf Javan and I decided to go to Carlos' Bakery the night before we had to leave Vegas. We decided the go 1 hour before they were closing and upon arriving there wasn't too long of a line and plenty of desserts and sweets to choose from. Adriana strongly recommended the lobster tail to me and when I saw the strawberry shortcake it was too hard to pass up. I also purchased one of their cannolis to see what it was about. Ordering and paying was quick and easy. The staff was very nice and helpful too. I barely watched Cake Boss when it was on TV but I was definitely hyped for this spot and the hype is real! If you're going to visit, get the lobster tail for sure. The crunchiness of the shell and buttercream together are a match made in heaven! The strawberry shortcake wasn't too sweet and just the right size to eat. The cannolis was soft the day after I bought it but still good. If you're at the Venetian, stop by and grab a lobster tail. You won't be disappointed!",1
"Have been to New York several times but never been able to come here because it's been busy and always out of the way. We got the lobster tail and the confetti cake. The lobster tail is amazing, and it is a must if you ever come here. It is so crunchy, and not burnt, and the cream filling is not too sweet at all, it's the perfect amount of sweet and whipped-ness (not a word, I know!). The way the lobster tail crumbles when you bite into it with the perfect amount of crisp is genius! The confetti cake on the other hand was way too sweet. I did not like it one single bit. I which they're able to use the same custard / cream filling in the lobster tail as the icing for the cake. That would be incredible. I truly found the cake way too dense and way too sweet. Two pairings that make it overwhelming. Overall: 10 out of 10 would recommend the lobster tail, 5/10 would recommend the cake, and 7/10 would recommend coming here. It is quite over priced",1
"My gf is a huge fan of Buddy so of course we had to check out the bakery! Stopped by the bakery for dessert after getting lunch at his restaurant. Overall satisfied and impressed with the quality of his desserts. We got the cannolis and one of the lobster pastry things. Not sure what they're called but it was heaven!! Loved everything about it. The filling is delicious and never had anything like it. Highly recommend Carlos bakery. Service was great as well. I was really hoping they'd have some desserts from his new show ""bake you rich"". Hopefully it's in the works.",1
"Friends, food, fun that's all a girl ever needs sometimes. That and several CANNOLI. Always wanted to come here because of the whole Cake Boss series. The icing on top were the cannolis! Friends and I were here at around 815 pm on Martin Luther King Jr day. There was a short line of about 5 people in front of us. It was my first time but I had my heart and tummy set, then someone mentioned the lobster tails! The place is pretty small, there's no place to eat and sit, but there's a nice shelf for you to quickly set your box of goodies down and stuff your face or mix your coffee, whatever floats your boat. There's a viewing window of the bakery but I really wasn't paying attention. There was a staff of two serving everyone and the bakery cold cases were fully stocked. Everything looked amazing. I stuck with my gut and got four cannolis- 2 chocolate dipped and 2 original, and an original lobster tail. Polite and quick with service, I would've stayed to ask questions but the line behind me was 10 deep. Got home and scarfed a cannoli down before bed, then ate my awesome lobster tail for breakfast with coffee the next day. I gotta say I will probably be back for more!",1
"My mother is a HUGE fan of Cake Boss and Next Great Baker, so I was insanely excited when my brother and I told her about the Vegas trip, and that we were going to take her to Carlo's. She was sooooo excited, and told everyone that she was going to Carlo's when she talked about Vegas. I'm sure her excitement probably got some people watching the show, at the very least, because she told that many people. Lol. My mother wanted a cannoli. This was her big thing. My brother got her one on her birthday, and she hated it. Lol. So she was a little hesitant to try it here, thinking it would be the same. This one was perfect. It was crispy, and sweet. My mom loved it. I'm so glad we convinced her to try it. We also had a lobster tail. I don't remember what kind it was, but there was a couple choices. It was my least favorite thing we tried. The outside was weirdly crispy, like I was chewing it forever. I ended up picking out the filling and just eating that. The selection in the bakery seemed a little weak, like they were out of a lot of things and the shelves were a bit empty. That was the one thing I noticed. Other than that, what we did have, I thoroughly enjoyed. That was my one big complaint, I suppose, if I could pick anything apart. The staff was amazing. That definitely stood out to me. We had a kid, I don't know his name, helping us. Even though the descriptions were listed on each thing in the display case, my mother conveniently missed that and started asking about different things and what was in them. This kid was more than patient. and didn't just say read the sign. Although, I'm sure he was thinking it. Lol. He was more than happy to discuss it with my mother and answered all of her questions thoroughly and with a smile. He gave us plates and a knife since we were sharing everything. He really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and it was a great experience. Would I return? Absolutely. I wish there was a Carlo's bakery closer to me than Las Vegas. But then I would be even fatter than I am now. Lol. But the experience was wonderful. It was so amazing to be able to take my mother here and try all of the things she has seen on TV from the show. Definitely worth a trip. Review 81 of 2017.",1
"My friend and I stumbled on this place as we were exploring the hotels. I love the show and have always wanted to get my hands on their goods! There was a line, it was around 10am on a Sunday. We didnt mind waiting as we just needed to satisfy our sweet tooth. While waiting in line you can watch the bakers making baking the delightful treats! As we got closer my eyes kept getting bigger and bigger. If their items were calorie free I would have ate more! Since we had already had breakfast I just got a canolli but decided to wait to eat it. After about and hour we sat down and enjoyed our treats. Everything tasted really good! I know for sure I will try their other items. Recommend if you get a chance to visit the Venetian hotel. I am not sure if it gets busier during the evening but the morning seemed to not be too bad. Note: I did not find their prices to be pricey as some reviews mentioned. Items made from scratch come at a cost, and you can taste the quality. It's a treat not a daily occurrence. Eat up and enjoy!",1
"We showed up without a reservation and we were seated right away. Josie, our waitress was not only extremely pleasant but incredibly quick and proficient and explaining the menu, taking our order and making sure that we received exactly what we expected. A great evening and we will for sure be back. We simply can't say enough about Josie and her upbeat personality and friendly reception during our stay.",1
These cannolis are a must get when you are by Carlo's Bakery. The taste is like no other cannoli out there. Really cool place!,1
"My mother and I went in to get a wedding cake ordered for my wedding for the 4th of July weekend and Shenel was amazing. I had been nervous about this process and Shenel, the pastry chef, made this experience so great and easy. I was pleasantly surprised how smooth the process went. Shenel put me at ease stating she would actually be the one who will make my cake. I could not be more grateful for her help and cannot wait to see how everything turns out. THANK YOU SO MUCH SHENEL!! -Sonny",1
"Always wanted to try this place but the lines were always so long. We lucked out on this day as there wasn't a line so we walked in and ordered the 4 pc cake deal for 26 bucks We got a red velvet, a chocolate, a confetti birthday, and a rainbow cake with strawberry frosting. Cakes were good, I think the chocolate was made on site, the rest were in a sealed container so north sure They were all yummy",1
Regretfully I was tooo full from BuddyVs restaurant and had a dessert to actually order a cake but I have to say that I admire the energy and whimsy that surrounds this bakery. People seem to flock to these colorful and enticing cakes and sweets. Probably the most iconic is the rainbow layer cake. I also realized that that are numerous Carlos Bakery vending machines with slices of cake scattered around the strip like in Paris. I look forward to trying a slice one of these days and then I will update the review with the verdict but since I tried the birthday cake at BuddyVs I am confident the cakes will be rich and delicious.,1
"This is a must try! Don't pass on the legendary Buddy's pastries. if you've never been, try the cannolis!",1
Carlo's Bakery made my wedding cake and all the pastries for our wedding! The cake was unbelievably delicious and absolutely more beautiful than I ever expected! Everyone raved about the pastries.,1
Lobster tail is as good as I remember. The pastry is crispy with lightly dusted powdered sugar and the cream is smooth and not too sweet. The rest of the pastries look okay. I come here mainly for the lobster tail. Before COVID the line usually wrapped around the corner but it is quick today.,1
This is by far my favorite place in Las Vegas!!! Ya wish they had one closer to Texas so I could come more often. Highly recommend if you want something sweet and at a good price!,1
"Excellent cake and cookie, I can taste the quality ingredients used to make the baked items. I did find it a bit pricey. Worth check out thought. Four thumbs up",1
Was a bit skeptical after reading the bad reviews but I went anyway because I love the show.. to my surprise it was actually pretty good! Ordered the lobster tail and the cannoli . Ordered regular flavors because I figured those would be best. The lobster tail was flakey and the cream inside was really good and sweet! Tasted like some type of cream cheese! Very unique; haven't tasted anything like it before. The cannoli was really good too. I do have another fav cannoli shop in West Hollywood so I was pretty sure that buddy's cannolis would taste bad based on the reviews but it was actually really delicious! It has its own taste to it and it wasn't too sweet or too plain! I enjoyed it. Huge fan of the show!!! Been waiting nearly 10 years to try Carlos bakery and I finally did! Although I'm upset that I haven't tried to actual jersey location but I guess this will have to do for now! Will try other items next time!! Location is a little difficult to find. Obviously in the Venetian hotel but the Venetian is completely complicated. Prices were kinda high but it's Carlos so ya knowwww,1
First Cannoli experience and it was incredible! I had the tradition and chocolate. Neither was too sweet which I liked. I'll definitely be back to try everything else!,1
Really pricey but the chocolate chip cookies are worth their weight in gold. They are now serving cake slices as well and I think it's a great way to sample their cakes before fully committing.,1
"Bakery is good, always busy. The cake is moist and very tasty. I've bought the cookies,cake and cannolis ,and I'll I can say is I want more!! So much to choose from!! Need to get back there",1
"Had the cannoli, lobster claw and strawberry rainbow cake. All were delicious. Service was pretty fast and place was great. Thanks!",1
The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. Cake is out of this world ! Had the chocolate fudge and a sprinkle cupcake. Both were A+,1
"Carlo's is right across the hallway from Buddy V's restaurant inside Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes and it's so worth the long walk to get there. I tried the pecan chocolate chip cookie which has 2 kinds of chocolate and the cookies and cream cupcake. Both were super sweet and amazing! Prices are normal for a casino, so there was nothing to complain about.",1
The cake was killer and we loved celebrating my birthday with Alice's if the sweet delicious rainbow cake!,1
I have been a huge fan for many many years. I have always wanted to go to this bakery. So when I saw Vegas had a bakery I HAD to go. This place is mega clean and the staff are very friendly. All of their treats looked amazing! Wish I could have bought more while there but we were headed to the airport right after. It was very good. All that I imagined that it would be! I would love to go here again soon! So happy I go the opportunity to come and try treats for myself.,1
"Staff was nice when I was there! It just kinda hard to find the location! I recommend the original cannoli, lobster tail and red velvet cake. The original Cannoli taste so much better in my opinion rather than the chocolate dipped one, cause the choco one for me was way too sweet for my liking. The lobster tails is my favorite but sometimes when you keep in the fridge too long of course the pastry kinda dry and so hard to bite. My suggestion is eat it right away for lobster tail since if you keep it too long it was way too hard to eat the pasty. The one that way over price is the cheesecake. The cheese cake is okay not that good and it almost $11 for small tiny cheesecake... yeah it's on the pricier side for all pasties and cakes.",1
"My husband surprised me with a red velvet cake from Carlo's Bakery in Vegas. I was not only blown away with his (my husband's) overall presentation but the cake itself was perfect. Moist, thick, not too sweet and perfect cake to icing ratio. Thank you for helping make my day special.",1
"I got there at 10:30pm on a Saturday and everything was well stocked. Except, they didn't have any crumb cakes. I ended up getting several cannolis, a red velvet cupcake, and original lobster tails. They also had samples of their red velvet cake available which was delicious. We brought the desserts back to our hotel room and enjoyed them right away. I was looking forward to tasting the lobster tails. I'm a big fan of the show and I've been wanting to try these for quite some time. Maybe it was because of the build up but I wasn't impressed with the texture or flavor of the shell. It tasted like it was stale and too crunchy. The cream was a little on the runny side but it had good flavor. Perhaps the texture of the shell would be different if it were fresh? I don't know. The cannoli. I'm not even a fan of cannoli but this, this was really really good. The cream was the perfect consistency and sweetness. The shell was crunchy and slightly flaky. Yum. Get it. You won't be disappointed. I bought enough stuff to get Carlo's Bakery swag (glass cup). If I were to return, I'd order a crumb cake in advance to try it out. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.",1
"We had to go her for our pasties of course, being a fan of Cake Boss and all. Well needless to say they do a wonderful job!!! We went 3 out of 4 days of being in Vegas, yummy all the way!! They do it right savory and sweet, we got a spinach feta croissant type pastry, caramel lobster tail, and chocolate croissant. Everything was so delicious and very memorable to say the least. The staff extremely knowledgeable and kind!! We will be back when we go back to Vegas!!",1
"Every time I'm in Vegas, i need to get their lobster tails. I failed in love with them in NY and since then, whenever I'm in a city that has Carlos bakery, I can't resist to get one, or two or maybe more... These are the best I ever had, the shell is very crunchy and not sweet at all, so it goes very well with the pastry filling that is light and delicious. I'm not a fan of theirs cannolis and other items. For me it's just the lobster tail. It's a bomb.",1
"The couple of experiences I've had here have all been positive. The lines are long of course but what do you expect? They're highly sought after. (The line is formed against the side and there's windows so you can see inside the bakery which is pretty cool while waiting). It's also alllll the way towards the end of the strip so it can be a walk if you stayed in the middle. If you really want to give the place a taste than the wait shouldn't be a problem considering everyone else is there trying to do the same, it's just about being courteous. Anywho I LOVED everything I tried so far (I will be back ahah) but my favorite treat are the cannolis omg they are so great, good crunch, yummy filling and I love the little chocolate chips and chocolate dip on my ends. Buddy was there on one of the days I went and I felt the passion in his work and I'm not just being a fan he's a hard worker, you can sense integrity.",1
Great selection and service. Order taker told me that the cannoli is the most popular item so that is what I ordered. It was awesome. Cream cheese was filled with chocolate chips. Baked items are also made in house.,1
"Got here right before they opened on a Friday morning! As soon as they opened I was greeted with a smile & Welcome to Carlos Bakery! I called before I arrived to Las Vegas and already received good customer service and had all my questions answered about the cake options & prices. I bought a beautiful white cake with fresh strawberries for my daughters 21st Birthday! It was delicious, moist and the strawberries were sweet! We all loved it!",1
Grew up watching cake boss and have been a big fan of buddy. For the birthday cake and it was pretty good. For some reason I expected a lot more given the hype this business has. It was still very good but maybe I just got the cake on the wrong day. Hope to return soon and have a better experience,1
"8/16/21 Another late review Always pass by but never had the opportunity to give it a chance and Finally we did! Love the easy set up, you order first on the bakery counter and then when they have your order ready they call you by name and you pay. Wait is not long at all, may seem long by the many people that go there but just wait, it goes by quickly. We got a box of cannolis that come with lobster tails and woww they are so worth the price!!! Cannolis are not too sweet they are just right on the sweetness. Definitely want to come back and try a slice of cake.",1
"Good tasting desserts. The red velvet cake is perfect, great flavor with cream cheese frosting that is not over powering. I also purchased a cannoli, which was delicious. Chocolate chips were in the cream which was an added surprise. The prices are rather high but you are paying for the name. I would hands down purchase from this location again. They were quick and spot on with the way they were running the bakery.",1
This cake was delicious! I was nervous it was going to be a little too sweet but it was the perfect balance. The cake was very moist and the frosting was delicious.,1
The shop exceeded my expectations! I dealt with Lisa from beginning to end and was not disappointed. You guys should definitely consider this spot for your sweet tooth!,1
"Although quite pricey, the cannoli sampler was awesome! It reminded me of this little hole in the wall spot back in Boston that locals kept to themselves about to avoid the touristy hype. The cookie I got was kind of dry and crumbly - I prefer the soft and chewy cookies. Would go back just for the cannolis.",1
Awesome service. They were able to make a last minute surprise birthday cake and on time.,1
We got the 5 pack of cannoli and 4 pack of lobster tails variety pack each. It was very delicious. The price was a little steep we paid 47.00 for both. I can say i ate at carlo's bakery and had the cannoli for 47 dollars. No line we were in and out very quickly. I enjoyed the experience can i find cheaper cannoli somewhere else? Maybe. Will it be as good as carlo's . But for my first Cannoli at least i have a good starting point for what i know is a good cannoli.,1
"This place is right on! It's tiny but the line moves fast. There was some confusion with my order. When the bill rang up to $40+, I was shocked but then they realized that they charged me for a whole cake rather than just 2 pieces. Then they had to open up the tied box to place the 2 pieces inside. Just as I was leaving they were going to give me my 2 lobster tails that were already in my bag. The lobster tail was so crispy and the cream inside was so smooth and tasty. The box of goodies flew home to Hawaii (stopped by TSA and the box had to be wiped for drugs or bomb residue) but luckily it didn't get confiscated and we got to get it home to be given as a gift to the caregiver of my 4 legged baby to thank her for her love and care while we were away.",1
A go-to location every trip to Vegas. Enjoy the lobster claws!,1
"When I found out there was a Carlo's Bakery in Vegas, boy was excited. I've haven't had the time to check out the one in LA, so when I found out there was one in Vegas I had to make a stop. I think the reviews are a little bit lower than they should be. Sure people expectations our high and so are the prices here. This place similar to Milk Bar in the Cosmopolitan is one of the most expensive places to pay for dessert. I only tried to item a chocolate Cannoli & hazelnut lobster claw. Just for those two things it was like 12 bucks, we could have really spent even more money, but I just wanted a taste. Originally I was going to go with the Oreo Lobster claw, but one of the employees said the hazel nut ones one of the best flavors. The lobster claw is like a croissant, but it is a little harder, the hazel nut cream was delicious. I thought my wife's cannoli was alright. I would come back though I feel like there could be more choices in unique baked goods.",1
"Due to Covid, they only allow a certain amount of people to come in, but they seem to be handling it well.",1
Chocolate cannoli to die for and actually not to sweet. My baby sis loves her rainbow cake slice and the lobster tails original and hazelnut ammmaZING! It was my dream to go to Carlo's bakery and get one of each and I did and those were by far my favorite but everything was delicious. My dad loved the hazelnut cookies and lemon ones too. My best friend said her fave was the double chocolate chip cookie and carrot cake. I will definitely be making this my go to stop before we leave.,1
"Got SUPER lucky & came on a day where there were only 2 people ahead of me in line! Anywho, the bakery is adorable! Located in the Venetian, it took forever to find (we parked @ self- park & walked through the shops by the Canal). But the trek to find it took us through areas we would have never seen otherwise! But it was so cute! There's big windows to watch cakes being decorated (but no one was in there while we were there)... Can definitely understand why people get aggro over the wait- it's pretty small & people tend to be indecisive and ask TONS of questions... When it was finally our turn at the cashier we ordered 2 chocolate covered cannolis, 4 Rainbow/Venetian/7 Layer Cookies, & an original Lobster Tail. The grand total camr out to just under $35??!!! I don't go to bakeries often, but I've never spent that much on 5 single baked goods & 4 Cookies?! But I will say this- they were REALLY, really good!!! The Cannolis here HUGE & generously filled. The shells were thicker than I'm used to, but they held up very well on our car ride home! The cookies were just like I remembered them... I used to get them from a little Italian bakery in my neighborhood growing up & rarely find them anymore- these were delicious! But the Lobster Tail- that was AMAZING & worth the $5.50!!! I was told the cream has bourbon in it but didn't think I would taste it, but it was definitely in there! It secretly made my husband and I happy that we didn't have to share it with the kiddos (LOL)!!! Definitely worth stopping by once if you're a fan of the show or looking for some Italian baked treats. I probably won't ever come back again but I'm glad I tried it once!",1
I wanted to pick up a cake for a special occasion and when I saw the picture of the rainbow cake I knew it was the one. I ordered the cake to be picked up the next day. When I arrived- at 11:30 on a Sunday morning there was no line at all and my cake was ready. They had placed it in the box and then wrapped the box in plastic which helped keep it fresh. The cake was EXACTLY as pictured. It was absolutely beautiful and tasted just as good. I loved all of the layers. If I lived closer I would order more often.,1
"All of their assorted goods looked very delicious and so creative! I marveled and drooled over their individual pastries and beautiful cupcakes! I highly recommend the lobster tail. It wasn't on display when I was in line, and had to order it. You bite into a very flaky and crispy outer coating to get an explosion of mildly sweet cream all in your mouth! Yes, it was quite a beautiful moment. The cannoli looked really tasty.. but I thought it was way too sweet for my liking. Overall, I think it was worth the wait though, it took about 30 minutes but there's just so many things you can choose from to try!",1
"Like most television promoted bakery's (or restaurants), it is expensive. Would prefer to be able to sit down to eat our baked goods but they do not offer that here. It's pick up and to-go only. Otherwise, all else is worthy and reasonable to give it a try. We'd recommend the cannolis and cookies (peanut butter and M&M's).",1
Pretty much what we expected to be. But the desserts were amazing we got so many I don't even remember all of them. You must try a chocolate covered strawberry and a mini cheesecake. They are definitely what it's all cracked up to be.,1
After 20 minutes of searching in the giant maze of a shopping mall I finally found Carlo's and I was so excited. Everything looked delicious. My son got their cookie and I got the traditional lobster tail with a latte to wash it down. So good! The staff is awesome!,1
"Ate my cheesecake too quickly to even take a picture. We were warmly greeted by the guy taking our order. He suggested he white chocolate mouse and dark chocolate moose. We ended up with the chocolate covered cheesecake. We ordered with him then went to go pay. Once ready, they call your name. The cheesecake was $12 but was AMAZING! So moist and delicious. Service was great and quick. Can't wait to try other cakes from Carlo's bakery",1
"Whatever you do, make sure to swing by for dessert and take it to a bench and watch the gondolas pass by in the Venetian. We took our friends there and had the famous rainbow cake or what the kids nicknamed ""unicorn"" cake- delicious! Definitely share it with someone! We had the cupcakes a little too dense for my liking. Got some chocolate covered strawberries too. Carlos is a great place to take the kids and have them watch the cake bakers decorate in front of them. And the choices of desserts- so many to chose from! Eat it all and then walk it off in the Venetians and Palazzo shops. Just don't try on jeans after!",1
"If you're a fan of Cake Boss, you know the name. If you're not a fan of Cake Boss, come anyways. The lines are long, but move pretty quickly. Our cupcake, cookies, and brownie were all excellent. The cookie was good, but I was in love with the brownie in particular. It tasted like a small piece of dense chocolate cake with a lovely rich icing. Definitely a great option for your sweet tooth. Take it to go, though. There's really not many places near the bakery to stop and eat at.",1
"Cupcakes were TERRIBLE dry like the mixture never had any wet ingredients:( I would never purchase again! However, the Cannolis are to die for....DELICIOUS especially the the lobster cannoli w/hazelnut cream and the cheesecake was good too but the cannolis was everything",1
Cannoli!!! Omg these were so good. We also got chocolate dipped strawberries which were food as well.,1
"An East Coast bakery out West? Sure, why not! I'm not going to complain when their offerings are delicious and decadent. They had something for everyone of us: chocolate dipped strawberry, cannoli, and a pecan sugar cookie wedge/square. Their signature pignoli cookies were delicious as well. Service was helpful, fast, and very friendly. Nice to have you here Buddy V!",1
As others have mentioned the wait in line is painfully long. That being said they are working as quickly as they possibly can to get you through the line in an efficient manner. As you can see in my photos we bought a lot of different things so we could try it all. Everything was delicious and I even have a coffee mug now as a souvenir from our visit. It is pricey so be prepared.,1
"Some background info for everyone that doesn't understand the hype and are giving poor review solely on the length of the line. Carlo's Bakery as well as Buddy V's directly across from it are famous restaurants/bakers due to the owner Chef Buddy Valastro star of Cake Boss on food network. Unless you're planning on being there at the butt crack of dawn when the open, plan on waiting in a line. Just like everything else that's famous, there is always a line, hence the famous part. In the end I still thought the pastries were amazing! After ordering about $60 worth of desserts I could not have been happier. The filling in the lobster tail was something of another world, in reality the flaky exterior is just a cup to hold all the cream. You're actually suppose to stick a straw in it and suck out all the filling. I was truly impressed by everything they had to offer. If you are ever in Vegas do yourself a favor and stop by this bakery,",1
"Love this place so much. Today, I got the sprinkle cookie. What a fun atmosphere and their desserts are so yummy. I'm a fan of the show, and been to the original bakery in Jersey. So, it makes it much more interesting going. Big fan of buddy! A must stop for tourists!",1
i got a vanilla confetti slice of cake and as soon as i got back to my room it was all gone because i instantly started eating. cant wait to visit vegas again cause ill be buying more than one slice next time,1
"Great selection of pastries and coffee, but the employees should be more attentive. They should be nicer, provide options instead of showing that they are ""bothered"" by people. When we went, there were only two costumers and like 4 employees!",1
Holy Cannoli... After two attempts I successfully purchased about $39 worth of pastries... I only indulged in the carrot cupcake so stay tuned for an updated review. So far so good. Be prepared to wait this is definitely a tourist spot which means long lines filled with adults and children who are uncertain what to order...,1
"I tried the canoli ($3.95)pastry from here and it was so good. The place was a mad house, just like it is on TV, but the employees are friendly and attentive. There was just enough variety to choose from, based on the size of the store, which wasn't too bad. I would go back again to try more baked goods.",1
"Pros: great pastries, lots of detail and work go into each pastry, great prices, friendly staff, and fast service... Cons: small inside and gets crowded... Overall, a must place to visit in Las Vegas if you love pastries...they put so much effort and detail in every pastry that goes out of the kitchen...FYI Carlo is Buddy V's dad and is located across Buddy V's restaurant...much respect for Carlo because he cares about his customers and the details matter...",1
"I'm a huge fan of the show Cake Boss and Buddy Velasco so when I heard there was a Carlos Bakery in Las Vegas, I had to go! Carlos Bakery is located in the Venetian Hotel. Its on the North end of the shopping area. The line wasn't too long when I went in the evening. Everything looked so delicious! Many people were ordering cakes but I wanted to try the cannoli and lobster tail... that's what I always see on his show. Wow, the cannoli was so good... One can be shared with two people, it's so big. The lobster tail was even more amazing than the cannoli. So crisp on the outside and flavorful on the inside. Oooh, yum! One day I would love to try his cakes. The prices were a bit pricey for everything. I got 6 cannolis and 3 lobster tail for a little over $45... but I got a free mug with it! :)",1
"Carlo's Bakery. Yet another reason not to move back to the east coast, because Buddy has literally brought my home back to me! I couldn't have been more excited when the head waiter at Buddy V's told me it might be opening up! And now, the time has come! I attended the Grand Opening--Waiting in line was epic. Seriously. If it's gonna be similar to that everyday, I think I might go before the place even opens to reserve my butt a spot in line! Most of Buddy's family was there! Taking pictures, some even passing out snacks for the waiting people in line! They are super funny and customer service oriented! AMBIANCE: 5 - The bakery is organized, bright, and really visual-there's a ton of things to see. The amazing display cases, bakery merchandise lines the back, the artsy design of the bakery, and there is an open window outside where you can see the bakers at work. This window is right across from the mirroring window at Buddy V's! SERVICE: 5 - Service was amazing, fast, and efficient! Buddy really teaches his workers to be quick, considerate, and plain delightful!!!! If you don't know, here's how it works: First you order, then they retrieve your order and you pay. It's a fast and slow process. So, when there is a long line, be PATIENT. The long line is mainly because of the customers; everyone is crowded and confused and trying to get done quickly, yet at the same time, wanting to see all the display cases and having to wiggle their way around people! FOOD: 5 - The food is bomb, and just like I remember it. Well, for the most part! I ordered lobster tails, red velvet cake and cupcake, napolean, tiramisu, and cream puffs. *deep breath* I might get fat because of this! But dammit, I'll die happy!!! The lobster tail is still their specialty, and STILL the best dang dessert I've ever had. Can I get a hallelujah for the price though!? Down by $9! Thank goodness for those original prices. Actually, prices for -all- items really range and are pretty reasonable. For Grand Opening week they'll be open til midnight! Sooooo am I comin' back? Of course!!! I'll be a regular before you know it!",1
"I found out about their lobster tail through social media, and when I saw the new flavors they had available, I had to stop by on my last visit to Las Vegas. I have to say, it's definitely worth a try! I got the salted caramel lobster tail and I thought it was just delicious! I ended up getting to try the traditional French cream when it was a day old and it was good too, but not as good as the salted caramel and a little stale. I would come back - would love to try their Cookies & Cream lobster tail next time! Lines weren't crazy at all when I went on a weekday mid-afternoon. Also, prices were reasonable for those treats in my opinion, just under $6 for one which I thought was a fair price for a place on the Strip. Any cheaper and I'd be tempted to get more, which wouldn't be great for the waistline :p",1
"Carlo's Bakery may have perhaps become a tourist attraction after Cake Boss aired but I still find that it's more than worth the stop. I have been to the original Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken, NJ and while the Las Vegas location can't compare to the shop in NJ, the treats are delish and that's what's important. I was close to giving up on stopping by Carlo's as it started to get late and I had heard the line gets crazy. I could not for the life of me find the bakery at The Venetian. When I quit looking, I found it and to my surprise, no line! I got a pecan sticky bun, a slice of carrot cake & cafÃ© latte. I enjoyed everything very much all while watching one of the bakers work through the glass window where you can see all the bakers in action. Service was fast and friendly. I thought $9 was a tad steep for a slice of cake but it was so good and, Vegas, so you know...worth it.",1
Got a Rick and Morty cake made for my daughter with Devils food chocolate cake and oreo cream filling with fondant. I am not a fondant lover but this was amazing! It was delicious and my daughter loved it. The staff are all very friendly. Money well spent. They also worked with me and answered any questions or concerns I had. I'll be ordering more future cakes.,1
"I had this cake for my birthday in Vegas on 8/4/19 and it was awesome! The Canoli was very good also! I brought a slice home to enjoy after my vacation. I wanted to get the whole cake, but didn't have room in my suitcase! I have to go back to Vegas very soon to get the cake again!",1
People were nice for sure organized. One of the best parts of our Vegas trip. They have covid precaution and social distancing we will be back,1
"Not bad, what's all the hype? Only 4 stools to sit. The lobster tail was interesting. Like a cream puff croissant. Cheesecake was good, a bit cakey.",1
Been here twice now and I would say their cannolis are a must try! The filling is really good and the shell is nice & crispy.,1
"This is long over due but so glad we made a visit to the Cake Boss ""Carlo's Bake Shop as of course, ""Im the real Boss ""B"" teeeee........heeee ;) We were the first to stand in line but of course since we no longer indulge in liquid poison and that is quite the absolute thrill of being in Vegas and really appreciate all the good food and breathtaking views of this magical adult play land. We were greeted by enthusiastic staff as they all were very friendly prior to opening, we talked of lovely conversations with the staff at how personable ""Buddy"" is and that he stops in regularly it also gave us time to feast our eyes on what we wanted to take with us back home. The shop is full of ""decadent"" & ""heavenly"" bite size of ""sweet happiness""! Rows of addictive treats in different shapes, colors & sizes and all taste as good as they look. I can vouch for that ""Sugar""! It was worth the time and calories waiting in line and I certainly look forward to my dolci on any sweet occasion.",1
"I only got the cannolis and lobster tails, which I personally really liked. Not sure why the reviews are so harsh. I never heard about this place before coming so maybe my expectations weren't super high like other people. The lobster tails were my favorite and I think it might be one of my favorite pastries ever",1
Amazing!!! I'm a big fan of the show. Had to stop here and I was not disappointed! I had the cappuccino and a chocolate cake slice and both were heaven! I was just excited to be able to try something from Carlo's bakery!! The staff were so helpful and really friendly. As chaotic as it was they took there time and treated you like you are the only customer they had. I can't wait to make this a tradition and go back!!,1
"I hear that the cannoli is superb here. BUT....we came to try one and ended up trying something else. My daughter is a Cake Boss enthusiast and wanted to come here. She also loves cannoli. She'd been looking forward to stopping by this place all day and we finally get to it, and she decides that she wants the cheesecake with chocolate mousse topping, topped with a chocolate covered strawberry. A little more pricy than I was hoping to spend, and my daughter only shared a teeny tiny taste with me, but since it was her special Las Vegas shop stop, I didn't mind. She ate the whole thing in less than three minutes and practically licked the container after....so with that said, it must've been pretty damn good! I've read other reviews about the staff being unfriendly and there being a long line, but on our visit, the staff was nice and there was only one person in line ahead of us. The selection was good for a small bakery. I don't recall there being any seats to sit at, but if there were, there were only a few. Most of the floor space was for guests to form a line if necessary and to browse the bakery displays. I'd definitely come back and try a cannoli or lobster tail on my next visit. If my daughter were with me, she'd make sure of it!",1
"I was so excited when I found out cake boss is in the same hotel that I was staying at, omg! However it was definitely a walk to find this place though. I'm sure there were quicker ways but oh well. The store is a lot smaller than I expected. Love how you can see behind the scene with the glass windows. We came at a good time because after we ordered, the line literally multiplied by 20. The ordering process was quick however I did not like the paying process. Other people in lines were complaining as well. So we stayed in line waiting to order then after we ordered we went in another line waiting to pay. WHAT. I felt like that literally just made the store more crowded and its just so unesscessary. We got the lobster tails, cream puff, chocolate mouse cream puff and a chocolate cannoli. I loved how crispy the lobster tails were however it was just TOO creamy in the inside for me. My boyfriend felt the same way. Everything was delicious but in our opinions, it was just way too sweet to our liking. I'll def come back when I'm in town but this time, just one lobster tail.",1
This place is busy. Got myself the chocolate covered strawberries cheesecake. It was really good. Place looks clean and you can see the area where they do their baking. Staff was friendly,1
"Line was long as usual. Tried the lobster tail pastry and the inside cream was good but the shell was hard. When I bit into it, literally the shell layers were so thick that it got stuck under my gums. It hurt for days and I take really good of my teeth. Overall, great pastries and cakes. Just that experience made me stay away from getting lobster tails.",1
"Too many sweets to choose from! I got a pleasant surprise today when the other half showed up with a bag from this bake shop! I've been sick & feeling crabby so this did the trick! To my surprise he got a lot of incredible goodies! Brownies that are so moist and come with a thick layer of fudge! A beautiful tiramisu that almost looks to good to break into. A vanilla cupcake because I'm obsessed with plain ones. A cream puff filled with decadent custard! Macaroons, a Nutella cookie, black & white cookies & chocolate covered strawberries! Talk about a way to a girls heart! I have no idea how we're going to eat all this stuff but we'll give it a good try! Everything I've ever tasted from this place has been great. Be prepared because it's very pricey but the quality is there.",1
"A trip to Carlo's Bakery was a must when my niece -- a big fan of the Cake Boss show -- learned of this west coast outpost. On Christmas eve morning there was a line about 20 minutes long at 11am. The items on display all looked impressive, but it was the lobster tail that I had my sights on. Its crunchy, yet light and airy shell gave way to an overabundance of smooth, rich cream filling. It's a signature item for sure that is well worth the caloric intake. Mini canolis, pre-filled to make service more efficient, still maintained their crunchy exterior. Their apple turnover was excellent -- all the flavors of an apple pie wrapped in a buttery and flaky pastry. The mini red velvet cake didn't disappoint either with its moist and chocolatey cake and cream cheese filling. My kid tried an oreo cake tower that I barely got to sample. He's now a fan of the bakery as well. Prices, as expected are astronomical. My wife, kid and I walked away $40+ poorer but sated from our pre-Christmas bounty. There is very limited seating in the bakery -- maybe 6 barstools that overlook the kitchen area. But, there is seating out towards Las Vegas Blvd, right outside Bouchon Bakery.",1
"Okay, my boyfriend is not a fan of sweets but he ate 4/5 cannolis and the only lobster tail I bought. I should've bought more. Will definitely be back on our next Vegas trip.",1
"I've never heard of Buddy before until my cousins told me about him while we were on Vegas. So since we were already in Vegas I wanted to try his bakeshop since many fans hype about it. The line is usually long when you get there so definitely come earlier (before 12pm). As I looked at the variety of deserts the bakeshop offers, I was drawn towards the cannoli and the cream puff. The cream puff was good, but I wish it had less cream in it because it was too overwhelming, but the cannoli was amazing. But don't get the chocolate covered cannoli cause it wasn't impressive. I give this place a 4 star because when we came in, the cashier worker was extremely rude. But everything else was a great experience.",1
I watch Buddy Valastro on the tv he's fantastic!!! His entire family is great !! I went to Vegas just because Buddy Valastro has a restaurant and a bakery. The cannoli was delicious as was everything that we tried. I definitely will be back. Buddy the next time I hope to meet Ralph in Hoboken New Jersey and anyone else that I can. You're the best!!!,1
"On our last trip to Vegas we had stumbled upon this bakery but were too full to try anything. For this next trip, I wanted to make sure I got to try one of the delicious looking pastries at this bakery. This is Buddy Valastro's (face of the Cake Boss TV show) bakery but I really didn't care about that much. It was the case after case of desserts that caught my interest. They are eye catching and there is a huge variety of what you can get. I also liked the unique take on old dessert favorites like the Boston creme pie, which they had in a little circular mold instead of as a pie slice. I got the Lobster Tail which is what they are known for. It's a croissant shaped like a lobster tail with powdered sugar on top and fluffy creme stuffed in the tail. I loved it and I felt like it was the extreme version of a creme puff. My husband got the Oreo cake tower. I'm not sure if it was written in the description but this turned out to be a cheesecake which my husband does NOT like. I didn't get to try it but based on the size of the dessert, a cheesecake would've been very rich. We had to wait in a line when we arrived but I know this isn't unusual for this place. The one thing I didn't like was how bored and disinterested the employees looked. They completely killed the fun vibe of this place and made you feel like you were in the Seinfield ""Soup Nazi"" episode when you place your order. You work with heavenly desserts all day; put on a smile!",1
"Pretty busy and at the time it wasn't much to choose from as far small treats but what I selected I was in heaven! They mainly had full cakes and cookies on display, like I said it was busy so I couldn't be mad of the limited selections. The only thing I didn't like was the ordering process but with limited space they do what they can. It's also a bit expensive but for the right dessert it's worth it! 'Lobster Tail' croissant like pastry with whipped cream in the center. This wasn't the dessert I picked but my cousin said it was a 3 out of 5. $5.50 I got the 'white chocolate mousse cake' 5 out of 5!!!! It was silky smooth white chocolate mousse with a dark chocolate outside and white chocolate shavings on the outside. It wasn't heavy or to rich. I would stand in line for that and pay the expensive price! $9.95",1
The shoppes on the second floor of the Venetian and is always busy plus you probably won't see Carlos. You can watch through the bakery window window and watch the cakes being made. The prices are expensive but it's worth it for a special occasion. Cupcakes are really good.,1
The mouthwAtering dark chocolate mousse! The Flakey & crusty Lobster tail! & Finally the nutty and creamy filling of the Cannoli! Cake Boss is the bomb! Worth the wait in line!,1
All I can say about this place is... you must try a chocolate covered strawberry! They are huge and juicy and delicious! The baked goods look amazing and taste like a little slice of heaven. They have bakers next door baking to fill up the yummy treats for the store. You can't go wrong with the deliciousness from here!,1
"Who hasn't seen Cake Boss?! I mean I HAD to come here. Cute, classy and clean little bake shop. I came here on a Tuesday morning so no crazy long lines. I must've lucked out. I got a small Cannoli, the famous Lobster Tail and a Pecan Danish. The Cannoli was pretty good. Light, crispy and not too sweet. The Pecan Danish was pretty good too. Buttery and rich with a lovely toasty crunch of pecans. The Lobster Tail was the best pasty I've ever had in my entire life. Layers upon layers of crispy, crunchy, flakey pastry encased around a rich and fluffy pastry cream. The pastry cream was freaking amazing and I could've eaten that alone with a spoon! It wasn't too sweet and had hints of amaretto and vanilla. If I could have a Lobster Tail once a week for my whole life I would die of happiness. One thing I liked a lot about this place, that the pastries are not overwhelmingly sweet, at least not the ones I got. I hate it when pastries and baked goods are too sweet. Service was fast but nothing extraordinary. I will be coming back here for my lobster tail every time I am in Vegas.",1
Their cannolis are awesome. The store is clean and it is in The Venetian. I also appreciate their ordering system. They take orders while people are in line so by the time you get to the counter it is ready. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would gladly go again.,1
Omg! The cannolis are delicious. I've had them elsewhere and nothing compares to the cannolis at Carlo's. I wish there was a bakery closer to me,1
"The line can get long and it's pretty slow. They only have 2 cashiers, if they are both working, and people (myself included) like to ask a million questions about each item. Luckily, when I came here the first time there wasn't a line (Friday around 8:30pm) and it was pretty quick. We purchased a 6in round red velvet cake the day before for my bosses birthday. They will write anything you want on it for free. While there, I took advantage of having no line and also purchased a carrot cake cupcake (not my favorite) and the lobster tail. WOW, I figured the lobster tail would be pretty lightweight, but considering it's a custard/whipped cream mix I should have known. This thing was dense, flaky and delicious. Honestly, it almost had too much filling. I took most of it out and picked around it because I felt guilty for how fattening it probably was, but it's definitely worth trying and splitting with 1 or 5 people :) Since we paid for the cake the day before, we didn't have to wait in the horribly long line come Saturday evening before dinner, we got there just before our 7:30pm reservation at another place nearby. Thankfully we paid beforehand because the line was INSANELY long. Luckily, the cake ready to go and packaged nicely. All in all, it took just a few minutes to get the cake and head out the door. People looked pretty upset that we walked straight up but hey! we already paid for it. The cake was delicious, moist and flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it and the price was definitely fair for the size. I think we paid $36-$40.",1
"I loved their lobster tail and cannoli!! Carlos' Bake Shop is a great bakery to visit if you 1) are a Cake Boss fan, 2) are at the Venetian Hotel, and 3) love yummy baked goods. The (estimated) 30 minutes in line passes quickly as you witness the magic that happens in the back. It was a treat to see their cupcakes being frosted and lobster tails being filled with cream. My favorite, however, was to see a baker successfully stack, dirty ice, and beautifully decorate four cakes in a matter of 10 minutes. My only caveat is that I didn't get to meet the great Buddy V.!",1
"I got the lobster tail and creme puff, i must say the lobster tail was good but the creme puff not so much. The filling in the lobster tail was really sweet. Would love to try their infamous cake sometime though. I will definitely be back!!!",1
"I haven't thought it's going to be big like that plus bakery , I loved more the food than the sweet the garlic bread I recommended it really good and tasty also staff so friendly",1
"This place is delicious! The chocolate mousse is amazing! Nice, friendly staff and it moves quickly. I visited twice while I was in Vegas! Love that we can enjoy Carlos Bakery on the west coast! I also love that they support the epilepsy foundation as it personally impacts Buddy's family and my family!",1
I love food and the detest that I pay every time the are made fresh every day so the customer service is always good and love see in the windows also that we know what we are revive good quality food from back east coast,1
So good!! The pastries are gorgeous to look at and melt in your mouth. We had a few cream puffs and the red velvet cake. I have never had any red velvet cake like it. The cream puffs were also delicious. The pastry was crisp and the cream filling is like clouds in your mouth. Hope to come back the next time we're here.,1
"Veeeery busy!!!! We stood in line for over an hour to try this place and it was well worth it. The prices of everything are very reasonable, especially the cannolis. They have a wonderful selection of cakes and mini cakes, cupcakes and everything else in between. REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE; Soooo my child was getting very frustrated and angry from waiting so long and by the time we got to the front she was screaming profusely!!!! She was acting crazy and being soooo loud. THEN one of the bakers working in the back actually came out and gave her a free cookie!!!! I wish I knew her name but she was African American with glasses and I really want to THANK HER and say how much I appreciated that gesture of kindness!!!!!! I hope she gets a raise because I know she deserves it just by being a sweet person!",1
"Second time visiting, had to get my Lobster Tail fix! Those suckers are addicting. The brownie was just okay and the regular cannoli was good, didn't care for the chocolate cannoli. It's best to go on Yelp to check out the pics, that way when it's your turn to order you pretty much know what you want. It's hard to see when you're in line because the people ahead of you are blocking the display case. It is pricey but hey it's the Cake Boss, lol.......and you are in Vegas. Enjoy!",1
"Cupcakes are to die for, the cake is delicious and the frosting WOW!!!! Hands down best frosting I have ever had. I tried the lobster tail, original filling. I feel like there was too much filling, but the pastry itself is so crispy fresh and really good. Went on a Sunday morning and unfortunately they didn't have cannoli's made yet, so picked up some cupcakes. Don't skip on the cupcakes!!",1
"Came here on a saturday afternoon. Finding the place was quite hard. Doriee and I couldn't really find info on it. Walked around the casino floor. Couldn't find it. All she knew was it was across from Buddy's. Decided to go upstairs (near front of casino) to the shops level. Saw an arrow with name pointing outside.. Walked to the right, outside, along a pathway, up a few steps, and saw Buddy's sign. Went inside the doors, and there the bakery was, across from Buddy's, with the huge amounts of people. We decided to grab a number. E28. Ok. They are on 10. Not long wait. Later we found out, they were on D10 ! OH MY GOD ! THEY ARE OVER A HUNDRED NUMBERS BEHIND ! ! Was told by a guy who was there for the bakery as well. Decided to wait anyway, since we were there. After a while, the guy was nice enough to give me his extra ticket. D63. Cut out wait times by half ! Whoever that guy was, thank you ! Fire alarms went off for some odd reason. Venetian security and maintenance, and etc came to investigate the ovens and what not. We had gotten a strawberry cheesecake and a lobster tail to share. Lobster Tail - fluffy, crispy puffed pastry filled with a sweet pastry cream. Made as a variation of the ""Sfogliatelle"" pastry meaning ""small, thin layers/leaves"". Crispy exterior. Sweet, creamy cream interior. Melody and orchestra of different flavors and textures. Strawberry cheesecake - traditional cheesecake with a HUGE stemmed strawberry on top with a light strawberry syrup sauce. Cheesecake was creamy and smooth. Not the smoothest cheesecake ive had but still pretty good. Strawberry syrup was nice and light. Not too sweet nor overpowering. Complimented cheesecake well. Didn't cover cheesecake flavor. Aside from the huge amounts of people and wait time, their products are pretty good. Their small cakes are a really reasonable price. Would love to eat the lobster tail again :D",1
"I love to try new bakeries so when I found out about this place I knew I needed to add it to the list. I wanted to try it because it was new to me, but apparently most people were there because of the TV show. We waited about 30 minutes in a line that wasn't really that long, but was crazy slow for some reason. The good thing about the line was that an employee greets you with a tray at the beginning and then walks the line with you as you pick items from the cases. This is good since you can't see anything in the cases until it's time to order. Hint, the items in the first case are the most expensive items. The line alone made me want to hate this place, but we really enjoyed our baked goods. My pecan snowball was the best pecan snowball I've ever had. It was full of flavor and moist, not a bit of dryness. The strawberry shortcake was yummy with juicy strawberries, moist shortcake, and lots of flavorful whipped cream topping. We also really enjoyed the M&M cookie and the mini cannoli. The cannoli had a nice crispy shell with a slightly sweet filling with a hint of cinnamon. The seven layer cookie wasn't my favorite. I couldn't taste any jam between the layers and it was pretty dry without the jam. My husband thought his frosted donut was good, but not the best donut ever. Overall, they have a few items that are great so I'll probably come back and brave the line again.",1
I've never had a slice of cake more moist and delicious in my life. Already craving another slice and extremely sad that it's not in arms reach. I tried the funfetti cake and the double chocolate cake and would highly recommend either - along with literally anything in the shop because it all looks (and smells) to die for,1
Service was great everyone was very nice and personable. We just about got one of everything and there wasn't anything we didn't enjoy. Would recommend anyone with a sweet tooth in Vegas to go here. I think my favorite was the cookies and cream lobster tail. It was light and crisp but not to hard and didn't get soggy from the cream inside. I'm a soft cookie fan and the cookies were on the harder side but they tasted fantastic.,1
"There was no line when i visited(Monday). The pastries are delicious. The prices are a little high, so be prepared to spend. The place was clean, the staff was nice. If you're in Vegas, then why not.",1
Beautiful cakes and delicious baked goods. They used to make an apple strudel which we loved but no more!?! Pastries and cakes are good when fresh. Apparently lots of people like the cannolis but i haven't tried yet. We got a slice of carrot cake--a must try! Cake is light and frosting was perfectly sweet and just the right amount. Going to try the one in Santa Monica which we didn't know was one there!!,1
"Rugelach: Double Chocolate Chip, Apricot, Raspberry w/ Raisins Lobster Tail ($5.95) Cream Puffs ($2.50) Hazelnut Cream Puffs ($2.50) Strawberry Tart ($2.50) Cannoli (sm; $2.50) Raspberry Linzer Tart ($3.50) Yeah, GOOD STUFF. I enjoyed everything in my box. The cream puffs are delicious and I loved the tarts. The cannoli was also good, though not my favorite pastry. The BEST pastry was absolutely the Lobster Tail. WOW. This was my first lobster tail experience and it blew me away. I loooove the layer after layer after layer of flaky pastry and the French cream was so scrumptious (they put a touch of Bailey's Irish Cream in it!). This is my kind of pastry! The line can get long, but when I visited, it moved REALLY quickly. Come early for fresh pastries and to, hopefully, beat some of the crowd.",1
"Waiting in line sucks... yes we all know this! But this is one line I'd wait in again. I had a lobster tail and a mini canoli. Should of gotten two lobster tails and large canoli as they were very delicious. I feel as if the lobster tail edges out the canoli but both are worth trying. Everything looks good, but is kinda pricey. Nothing is better then some yummy pastries and walking throughout the Venetian.",1
"Ok first off, this place SMELLS like heaven! (What I imagine heaven smells like, anyway) The line was quite long for pastries. I waited about 20 minutes before it was my turn but it was well worth the wait. There's so many desserts to choose from, but I chose a regular cannoli, chocolate cannoli, white chocolate mousse cake and a hazelnut cream puff. I really wanted a black and white cookie but unfortunately they were sold out for the day. Everything I chose was delicious! My favorite would have to be the white chocolate mousse. At $9.95 I was a bit skeptical on whether it would be worth the money but I'd happily pay this again. I may have eaten the whole thing by myself.............. Not sorry. The cannolis were awesome. They tasted homemade, as they should. I preferred the regular cannoli over the chocolate covered one. I recommend letting them sit out like 10 mins before eating them because when they're straight from the fridge it's a bit hard to bite into. It tasted better when thawed out :) Good thing I don't live near Carlo's because I'd be super fat if I did (but I'd be happyyyy)!",1
"Delicious deserts. I got the lobster tail and it was fresh, flaky, and the cream was rich and airy. I just would definitely recommend it this place to anyone wanting a sweet treat. The variety of desert was vast and service was courteous and quick. Price was fitting for Vegas, but not outrageous. I will be back and try more. They were also accommodating to a couple who wanted something they were currently out of and were willing to take an order for the next day.",1
"Came here for some dessert treats during our 10-Year Wedding Anniversary in Las Vegas. They didn't disappoint, we were able to make our order and were out the door in no time at all.",1
"I went back in June on a Sunday afternoon to Carlo's bake shop and no lines at all. I waited with my brother and sister in line for a few minutes until someone helped us. Too much to choose from cannoli cupcakes, and cookies. Next, we lined up at the cashier to pay our items and the line wasn't long at all. They make the best Italian cookies and cannoli with fresh cream and good crunch. Lots of people linger to looky loo or just waiting for their orders. Its fun to watch the bakers frost the tray of cupcakes or making cookies. I will definitely go back again.",1
"The desserts were incredible. My husband and I loved the lobster tail! I usually don't like this kind of pastry since there is so little filling at other places, but this was filled to the brim and delicious! We tried a bunch of different things since I watched the show and was determined to make it out here. The strawberry cheesecake was probably the best my cheesecake loving husband had ever had. I even loved it and I usually don't like cheesecake. The line was long even at 10pm, but worth the stop. I just wish they had some chairs and tables nearby to eat our treats. We did find benches back by the canal near the stores. It is also very expensive sometimes be careful how much you order. It would have helped the line move quicker if they had signs of what everything was instead of everyone having to ask when they ordered.",1
Delicious cannolis! The shells were crisp and fresh and the cream went all the way through. Worth the price. Got an Oreo tower and a white chocolate mousse that I will update about later. Edit: both other desserts were amazing,1
"So far, this is one of my favorite Italian Bakeries in Las Vegas. We walked in about 10:30 am and it wasn't busy at all. We talked with Austin while placing our order and he gave us a few great suggestions. I liked the Nutella filled cookie, Pistachio Biscotti, butter cookies, Cannoli, and the Boston Cream. The Cannoli sweet, with chocolate chips, a great filling and a fresh crunch. I hate soggy ones, so this made my day. We waited to pay as he wrapped our purchases in boxes and even tied them shut with a string. It wasn't a speedy transaction and it can be a little pricey for some (I got a lot of stuff for $26.00), but it's Vegas. Live a little. For great Italian baked goods, service and attitude, this is the place!",1
"BROWNIE. That's all I have to say. Best brownie I've ever had. Didn't get to eat it until the next day and it was still soft and so good. Also got a cannoli, the chocolate covered, and it was delicious! Can't go wrong with anything you get there!",1
Carlo's Bakery is located inside the Venetian right across from Buddy V's Ristorante. There was a bit of a line when we went but it went fairly fast. I ordered the lobster tail and it was crispy and delicious. My daughter ordered a cheesecake and was not disappointed. The only complaint I have is that there is no seating outside or anywhere nearby. We had to walk around and find a place to sit. They should at least put a few benches outside.,1
So many mixed reviews. Everything I ordered was actually good. Probably one of the best cannoli I've had. I didn't know what to expect from the lobster tail but it was decent I guess. The filling wasn't as sweet as the cannoli but it was still good. Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting was amazing too and this is coming from someone who hates chocolate cake. It was melt in your mouth perfection. Don't remember what else I ordered $50 later in dessert but got free apron.,1
"One of the best cupcakes I've ever had. Moist and not too sweet vanilla cake topped with a delicious buttercream- none of that fake sugary sweet icing. Wish they would put prices up next to each item. My cupcake turned out to be close to $4, but that's okay because it was delicious! Hardly a line at 9:30 pm on a Friday night.",1
This place is amazing. I was lucky enough not to wait for to long to get my deserts! Many options and it was kept stocked. My next stop is the restaurant !,1
"As an omnivore, I enjoy trying everything, including vegan fare. And I've got to say that the eponymous vegan doughnuts here are virtually indistinguishable from ""normal"" ones and are just as scrumptious as the most blingy ""gourmet"" varieties that I've had. And talking about gourmet donuts, there are a dozen varieties here, each of which are not just pretty to look at and therefore Instagrammable, but are also super scrumptious and high quality. No SoCal ""style"" over substance, that's for sure. Whether the blueberry cake, raspberry and sprinkles, strawberry shortcake, or old-fashioned, each donut I tried was light and flufly yet sufficiently doughy and dense so as not to leave you feeling guilty about empty carbs. At $2.00-3.50 each, prices were reasonable given the presentation and intrinsic quality. Be sure to get here first thing in the morning because they can sell out fast - and close early. Deservedly so. Thanks Yelpers for yet another solid, local, independent find!",1
"We were walking to get some coffee and decided to stop in. They were going to close in less than 20 minutes. Lots of good options. Some of which rotate. We got a lemonade lavender, strawberry, and a blueberry one. All so delicious! Couldn't tell it was vegan and the texture and flavors are better than most donuts I've had. Staff was nice! 2 of them. They helped give suggestions and didn't rush us even though they were closing soon.",1
"Visited The Vegan Doughnut Company today after much anticipation and hearing many rave reviews!! It 100% lived up to the hype! I tried the Fruity Cereal Milk and wow, it was delicious. The dough was so airy, fluffy, and light. It was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. I also tried a few bites of their Easter-themed doughnuts, which were more of a cake doughnut consistency and also top-notch. The quality of these doughnuts is truly unmatched. I've heard a non-vegan say that these were the best doughnuts they've ever had. The location of the Vegan Doughnut Company is extremely convenient, on the main street of Lakewood. There is ample parking space in the lot for the shopping center behind the shop. Love to support this excellent local business.",1
"Honestly amazing. We've been here more than 5 times in the last couple of months. This place has become our go to donut spot around Cleveland and will highly recommend. Initially, we were skeptical since it was ""vegan"" and with that, we were worried that the cream or the dough might not taste as good as a traditional donut. Obviously, we were wrong and the bakers at the company has proven that their donuts are even better than traditional flour/milk donuts. The flavors are strong, but not overbearing. The sweetness is just right and the dough is always fluffy. Price is around 2-3$ per donut, which is normal for more artisan donuts around here. Our favorites include the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, the donut with dragon fruit flavor and lemon lavender.",1
Hooooly hell these are some truly delicious doughnuts! Got up early and made the short drive to Lakewood to pick up a dozen vegan doughnuts! The staff was so friendly and recommended which I should try. Their menu changes each month so there's new flavors to try every month! Parking is available on the street and these can be a little pricey but you get some BIG doughnuts and they're probably the best vegan ones I've had!,1
Hands down the best donuts in Cleveland. Their flavors change every month and are always very creative and fun. The Choco Taco donut was my favorite. All the donuts had great texture and all the toppings weren't too sweet and went very well the donuts.,1
"No complaints from me! All were good! The lemon lavender, and the Boston Cream were EXCELLENT! My family loved the other flavors too! Bring a good container to get 10% off. Thank you! We will be back!",1
"Went here on a Saturday afternoon, they still had a great collection. We tried the key lime, strawberry shortcake, key lime, carrot cake, cookie dough and lemon lavender. They were all so fresh and you couldn't even tell they were vegan. My favorite was the key lime and carrot cake. Staff was all nice and helpful! Would definitely go again.",1
These donuts are great and taste as good as they look. They're not too sweet and not greasy at all. I brought these to a party and no one knew it was vegan until I told them.,1
I'm in love. They've put a lot of thought into these doughnuts and the store itself (love the store decor and vibes). The doughnuts are delightfully light yet you get all the flavor profiles. It's not just that sugar flavor either. I'm not vegan but I think vegan doughnut company might be my favorite doughnuts ever.,1
"I really enjoyed my visit here this weekend with my family. The doughnuts are, by far, the best in Cleveland. The shop was clean and beautiful. The staff were friendly and super nice. There is absolutely no room for improvement here because it is perfect. I can't wait to visit every month to try the different flavors.",1
Long lines from open to sell out for all four days of the week they're open. 6 donuts was $15.75. Mostly yeast donuts cut in half with filling between the two halves. Unique flavors such as matcha cream and creme brÃ»lÃ©e. The lavender lemon was absolutely spot on with a deliciously aromatic sprinkling of lavender buds atop a genuine lemon glaze that was just enough sweet and sour. The egg nog donut also had a true to name flavored cream on top of the glaze. The yeast donut texture is the same as a very chewy dinner roll which is not my jam. Too dense and again so chewy it's like a more tough pull-apart. Pricey at $2-3 per donut but worth the novelty to try once.,1
"They flavors are always amazing! They are all so sweet when we stop in. We've only been twice but will definitely be back for more! My son and I LOVE the lemon lavender and our all time favorite was the chocolate candied ""bacon"" from a few years ago! Can't wait to try the key lime pie this month",1
"UPDATED REVIEW -- The 2 young women who own this vegan doughnut shop are the sweetest. They are truly passionate about their business. It is so awesome to see a black owned business in Lakewood. I am always greeted with a smile and I feel welcomed anytime I come here. Now that I've tried other doughnuts in the Cleveland area, I will say that these are tasty. They are soft but actually a bit too sweet. It is almost as if you can taste the sugar. I especially feel this when I taste the Lavender doughnut. These are vegan doughnuts so they are made without milk. I do appreciate that the price has gone down from $3 a doughnut to $2 a doughnut which is affordable. I will be back here but the hours here are still limited. They are opened Fridays - Sundays.",1
So so happy to have an all vegan donut shop in the CLE. Awesome donuts and very kind and friendly staff. I highly recommend it!!,1
"I was happily surprised this place lived up to its hype!! Food 5/5 These donuts are FIRE. The dough is loose and fluffy, almost like brioche!! The flavors are unique and tasteful, but none were too sweet at all! They also are cleanly decorated, not overflowing with icing or messy at all. I'm shook that these are vegan I would never have guessed by their taste and texture. Highly recommend strawberry shortcake and cookie butter! Service 4/5 Line took about 40min after getting there at opening time (9am on a Sunday)! But the employees were super nice, and they have social distancing policy of only allowing one party into the store at a time and masks required! The place was pristine and very clean. Will definitely be back. Best donuts in cleveland yet!",1
"AMAZING doughnuts for vegans and non-vegans alike!! I'm usually out of town on the weekends so my mom waited in line for about 30 minutes yesterday morning to get us some doughnuts. It was well worth it. We got the key lime pie, glazed twist, blueberry cake, strawberry shortcake and raspberry lemonade. The blueberry cake was my personal favorite but I'm also partial to cake doughnuts but it was delicious and not super oily or overly sugary. The perfect cake doughnut. My mom and aunt loved the key lime and strawberry shortcake, some of the best doughnuts they've ever had they said. Love that their menu changes a little every month so I already know I'll be back to try out whatever new flavors they whip up.",1
"Probably the best donuts in Cleveland, and incredible that they're vegan too! They always have the classics and fun new flavors - I got the glazed, citrus and cardamom, lavender lemon, tiramisu. All were great and they're always changing up the menu! Be sure to get in on the earlier side, because they do sell out of flavor later in the afternoon. Definitely going back next time I'm craving a donut.",1
"These are seriously, without a doubt, the MOST DELICIOUS donuts to ever enter my stupid donut-loving mouth. Holy crapola! For months before even moving to the Cleveland area, I've been follow Vegan Doughnut Company on Instagram and daydreaming of one day eating their beautiful square shaped goodies. Finally, they've reopened to public on Saturday and Sundays and oh my goodness gracious, it was worth the wait. I would honestly have NO idea that these donuts were vegan if it weren't so obvious in the name. Everything from the dough, to the toppings, to the fillings are plant-based and finger-licking good. Like, lick out the box good. I've tried 8 different donuts of theirs in the past few weeks and intend on continuing to persuade my husband to go early on the weekends to wait in line for his sweet tooth wifey (aka me). And wait, you will! They open at 9am on Saturday and SUndays and depending on what time you jump in line, there's a good chance that you'll wait in line upwards of an hour. BUT let me tell you, it's worth it! And they run out quick, so waiting in line is your only option currently. Support local y'all! YUM IN MY TUM!",1
Lots of special flavors the coconut bacon is my favorite. However I do find all the donuts are way too sweet.,1
"My husband wanted to purchase donuts on my birthday, so we decided to check this place out. So glad we did!!! The doughnuts are amazing! The shop is small, clean, quaint and full of plants (which I love). As soon as we entered, we were immediately welcomed. The young lady behind the counter was warm and friendly, always smiling. There were a wonderful assortment of vegan doughnuts, which made it very hard to choose. We settled for 2 twisted glazed, 2 strawberry shortcakes (yum) and 2 lemon lavenders (interesting). We couldn't wait to get home to try them, so we began eating in the car - lol. The doughnuts were super moist and delicious! We were very surprised at the sweetness and the strawberry shortcake doughnuts taste as if there are real strawberries in the icing. The store is in Lakewood, OH and very easy to find. We parked on a side street and walked up. There are an array of other interesting stores in the area too. I highly recommend this establishment and will most definitely return!",1
"If going vegan tastes like this, why aren't we all vegan! I keep hearing about TVDC, today I passed it and made a quick decision to pull over and grab some. I've found a new favorite spot. TVDC is absolutely stunning inside. It's a small in and out space, but walking in feels so magical! Staff was so nice and helpful when picking out which to get. Often times with vegan remakes of food, things often times just feel ""off"" but not with these donuts. You seriously would have NO idea that these were vegan, which is what makes them to die for. My two favorites I tried were the tiramisu and the strawberry shortcake. Seriously, this place rocks. Go show love to this Female Owned, Black Owned, Cleveland Local, small business ASAP.",1
Okay Yum! I love these donuts!!!! The key lime one is my favorite! Can't wait to go back!,1
"The word ""vegan"" isn't normally my cup of tea, but these fresh and colorful donuts did not disappoint. I waited ten minutes in a very quick line and chose from maybe 8 colorful donut options. I really enjoyed the strawberry cream filled one and the strawberry shortcake was also a hit. Will be back.",1
"This place is adorable and the staff was incredibly friendly. I was visiting from out of town and happened to stumble upon this place. I'm so glad I did!! I always seek out vegan donuts when I travel and this little shop blew me away. Some of the best donuts I've ever had. I tried the cookie dough, hibiscus sprinkle, cookies and cream, and lemon lavender. They were all incredible but the cookie dough stole the show. Will definitely be back when I'm in town again.",1
"The freshest doughnut I have EVER had. Even if you're not vegan, these are a total hit and an awesome opportunity for those who are vegan. The store is welcoming and a fun atmosphere. We waited in line on Christmas Eve morning and did not mind at all as everyone was patient and the staff was doing a great job handling the crowd. Added bonus that is a small business and family run! Every flavor was great but I would highly recommend the maple cream filled and old fashioned.",1
I've been eyeing this place for a while. I finally made my way inside and the atmosphere was quaint and relaxed. The staff was also very friendly. I got the famous lemon lavender and a strawberry shortcake. I am not a fan of lemon desserts but both of these donuts were possibly the best donuts i've ever had. I am questioning if they are vegan because they are that good! Will definitely be coming back.,1
"Still a good donut/doughnut! I stopped in recently at their new brick and mortar storefront in Lakewood. I went with the strawberry sprinkles, lemon lavender, and the maple with coconut bacon. They are $2.50 each and pretty good. (Well, minus the one with coconut that they tried to make taste like bacon since this is a vegan place. Just not for me.) If you're in the area stop and give them a try!",1
"We were so happy to find this wonderful place! My daughter is newly vegan, and our family has a tradition of scouring the cities we visit for the best donuts! These were it! The whole family enjoyed them... husband and kids loved the Cookies and Cream, but I really enjoyed the unique flavor of the Lemon Lavender. Cute, clean shop was a plus, too! I wish they had a place like this at home.",1
I was amazed with the doughnuts from the vegan doughnut company. They tasted better than normal doughnuts and didn't leave me feeling sick after eating them. My favorites were the pumpkin spice and the strawberry short cake. They were also a hit with my friends!,1
"Yum yum YUM!! As a donut fanatic I had heard a lot of hype around the vegan doughnut company well before I went in for my first visit. My friends and I planned to show up right at opening time (9 am) on a beautiful Sunday morning -- and when we got there the line was already AROUND THE BLOCK. We waited in line for ~40 minutes, but the moment we got inside, we knew the wait was worth it. All their donuts were beautifully decorated and consisted of more traditional flavors, but also, more unique ones. We ordered a box consisting of strawberry cream, cookies & cream, lemon lavender, maple cream, and more! They were all SO GOOOD-- the donuts were delicious, weren't too overly sweet, and I couldn't even tell that they were vegan. My favorite flavor was the lemon lavendar because it was a nice combination of tart + sweet. So before you go, make sure to double check their hours since they are pretty limited (and you should definitely try to show up early so the donut flavors you want don't run out). In addition, their menu is always changing, so you should look at their website or instagram page too for those! Fun fact: The two co-founders attended the same high school I went to in the Cleveland area, so that pretty awesome! Will definitely continue supporting them and am excited to see their business continue to grow",1
"Soooo the Apple brÃ»lÃ©e doughnut?! - ridiculously tasty. Even though the doughnut wasn't cooked through all the way, it was STILL MAD TASTY. It was that good. The glazed twist tasted like biscuits from the can fried at home, that I then glazed. I wasn't blown away by that. I'll definitely be back to try the specialized doughnut. Also, they could use more clear signage inside of the store. Overall, this is a great place!",1
"Probably my favorite donuts in cleveland and they're VEGAN. I've been here twice now and was able to try several of the different flavors - all of them looked amazing and tasted even better! Couldn't even tell they were vegan. The donuts were light and not greasy or overwhelmingly sweet. They have so many fun and unique flavors. The menu changes every month (check their insta for the latest!), so there's always something new to try. The lavender lemon, tiramisu, and blueberry cake donuts were my absolute favorites, but you really can't go wrong. The line can get long so try to go early, but the wait is WORTH it. They have also incorporated safe social distancing measures, allowing only one customer/party into the store at a time. Also, their hours are limited so be sure to check them before going!",1
Went to buy a friend a treat who happens to be vegan. I am not. Bought myself some also. So pleasantly surprised! They are delicious. She loved them too.,1
These are the donuts I got! They are so pretty and I had one so far (the cake one) and it was great! Cute place too,1
"Vegans and Non-vegans alike will enjoy these delicious treats. I loved the lemon lavender and the cookies and cream flavors. The dough for the square doughnuts is very unique, it has a great texture and doesn't feel too heavy in your stomach. The sisters running the show are always smiling and super friendly. I've found a new guilty pleasure.",1
"I'm not even vegan (but enjoy an occasional vegan meal), but these doughnuts are popping!! Man I will stand in line waiting outside again for these! I love the menu changes every month too. This place is awesome!!",1
"Excellent donuts!!! They currently have a great fall selection-the Maple Cream is amazingggg. The old fashioned pumpkin is lovely too! The only downfall was that there were no drinks/coffee options. I was hoping to grab a cup of coffee at the same time. But not a huge deal, as the Starbucks is a block away. 9/10 will be back again!!!",1
These donuts are better than non-vegan donuts. You know when you finally see some goodness in the world and it inspires you to live your life a little more optimistically. That's what I felt when I bit into the strawberry shortcake donut. Their blueberry cake donut was also amazing. Would highly highly highly highly highly highly recommend. The owners are also very down to earth and lovely,1
"Doughnuts are good. It's even better if they come vegan, which are hard to find but you can find these here. The Vegan Doughnut Company is a small store. A counter displays all the doughnuts. You can get a box or bring a container here with you. Handcrafted doughnuts like these are better than any you get commercially. It tastes so much fresher, because these are actually made here. They always have a large variety. All the flavors sound good. Some of the flavors include classics like chocolate and vanilla. A few more exotic flavors include banana nut, maple with coconut bacon pieces, and strawberry. The donuts are $2 each, which isn't bad for something like this. It tastes just like regular donuts. That means they're good, and while they may not be much healthier they're made of higher quality. It doesn't have any room to sit inside. Outside there's a picnic table along the wall so there's somewhere close to sit. They have somewhat limited hours plus they close when they run out, which",1
"Vegan means it's healthy right? If you like doughnuts, you have to check this place out. Great variety of flavors and overly delicious. You can't go wrong with this place. There is a line but thats because it delicious and because they are doing their part to limit the number of people in their store. Don't forget a mask. #covid however it well worth the wait ladies and gentlemen",1
"Inconspicuous from the main road, I'd say this shop is a gem for the community especially transitioning vegans or vegans with a sweet tooth! Entering the shop is like going into a calm oasis. I loved the minimal, earthy, yet chic vibe. While no one was visible upon entry, I was still greeted almost immediately by two smiling faces that came from the back. With a perfect amount of options, this place has something for everyone, cake and yeast- based doughnuts with great flavors (both common and unique). The cookie butter is a cream filled doughnut and I appreciate the crumble on top. I love the passion fruit doughnut, but think it could've done without the sprinkles. However, they didn't detract, just didn't add to it. I'd recommend adding a fresh fruit like slices strawberries or blueberries if want to add color. The blueberry doughnut was a cake doughnut and familiar to taste, so good. Lastly, I went out on a limb and tried the lemon lavender and I must say it was magical! Sometimes less is more, and I think this spot has unlocked something great. IMO def better that Jack Frost and a contender with Duck Donuts. Thoroughly pleased and quite impressed. Vegan done right!",1
This place does vegan SO well. The doughnuts were fluffy and delicious. You couldn't even tell the difference between these and a non-vegan. What's even better is they are local and women-owned. Great job ladies!!,1
"Went for a surprise date in Cleveland the other weekend: I wanted to get something new to try and I heard rave reviews about this place. Thankfully it was quiet when we arrived so we didn't have to wait. Most of the donuts had already sold, so there wasn't many left. After carefully deciding of 6 different donuts we took them with us to eat over the course of the next few days. Let me tell you, folks: delicious. Not overwhelmingly sweet or oily, the flavor is honestly really good. I think lemon lavender was my favorite: sweet, with a tart aftertaste and even almost savory! I was a big fan of all of these. I'm not sure if the business is black-owned, but the staff was all Black and I am honestly HERE for more black-owned vegan businesses coming about! Give this place a try, PLEASE.",1
"You guys, VEGAN DOUGHNUTS...like actual doughnuts. My family and I went on Sunday (my birthday), and we got a dozen of mixed flavors. My favorite was the maple coconut bacon flavor, and my boyfriend's favorite was the blueberry. The lemon lavender was unique and tasty as well. The shop is decorated SO cute - I love all the plants. We traveled from an hour away, and we were not disappointed. =] delish!",1
"these are amazing doughnuts, as you can tell from the line out the door when you get there when it opens! they have a lot of options, and they're also super instagrammable! definitely a good stop in Lakewood!",1
"Wife brought these home this morning. Didn't even realize they were vegan. We tried roughly 8 flavors and the lemon lavender were hot fire good, all the rest were pretty outstanding as well. Welcome to the neighborhood!",1
"Such a great addition to Lakewood! These donuts always taste fresh and I love the fun flavors they come up with. I'm not a vegan but haven't really been able to tell the difference in most flavors. Everything is good, service is quick, and they really know what they're doing here!! A must go.",1
"I love The Vegan Doughnut Company! If you didn't know these donuts were vegan, you might never know. I'm not a vegan, but I sought them out once at a festival pre-covid because I wanted to see what the hype was about. I completely understand now why the line was wrapped around the building and up the street. Again, these doughnuts don't have some strange vegan-y aftertaste. To me, they taste just like the real deal, full of gluten-y goodness. My favorite flavor is the Lemon Lavender. These sisters make some truly delightful doughnuts in excellent flavors. You're also supporting a local, non-chain, black-owned biz and some really awesome ladies. I have yet to visit their actual brick-and-mortar in Lakewood, but I certainly plan to once the pandemic improves. Don't wait. Get there early or you'll miss out. Follow them on social media and you'll always be in-the-know on the rotating flavors and status of the shop. Afterall, they sell out regularly! A true Cleveland gem!",1
"I tried this place after reading great reviews on social media sites. I have to say that the reviews were spot on; this place is fantastic. The staff was quite helpful when I went to place my order. I bought a variety of their donuts, and they were all excellent. Definitely call before going because the shop tends to sell out. I cannot wait to go again.",1
Pretty amazing for a vegan donut and the prices are what are expected for quality of donut. I really enjoyed my donut and will return again. They have plenty of options to more traditional to contemporary. Their is a little park next door with benches if you would like to enjoy the donut right away. I brought mine home to enjoy. The staff was kind and sometimes I see a huge line but today around 10 am I was able to walk right in with plenty to select from.,1
This is literally my favorite place on planet Earth. I've been following these guys around ever since they were just a pop up shop and every donut has been amazing. The family who runs it is also super friendly. You'll love them too.,1
The customer service and the donuts were awesome! I traveled from Lake County with my family and it was well worth the trip. The doughnuts were well made and tasty.,1
"Cute little doughnut place in Lakewood. Their prices are reasonable from $2-3. I got the maple cream-filled and glazed twist, and they both taste amazing! If you're lactose-intolerant or just want a quick snack I'd stop by.",1
"Delicious doughnuts, great menu that changes all the time. Better than most donuts I've tried. Friendly staff too.",1
"So doughnuts are one of my favorite foods, and though I'm not vegan, I prefer it if it's available. This place does not disappoint and I struggle not to come here every week! Always a friendly staff, super cute but simple interior (take out only). All the focus on the doughnuts! Strawberry shortcake is one of my favorites, as well as the lemon lavender. It's really hard to get only two.. I also had the Boston cream",1
Best donuts ever. I'm not even vegan but I can't even taste a regular donut now because it won't be as good. Wow they are so sweet yet not that sweet where it's gonna hurt your teeth. They have sooo many kinds of flavors and I love how they come out with new ones every month. Beware thought because they're not open everyday and when they are they sell out FAST. Like there will be a line out the door and for good reason. And you may not like the prices at first but these are fulling donuts. You're getting your money's worth!,1
"Best donuts I've ever had and I'm not even vegan or remotely close to, HOWEVER, I'm interested in trying more vegan places if they're all as delish. If the line looks long, don't let that discourage you - it moves pretty fast and it's well worth the wait.",1
"They taste even prettier than they look and that says a lot with these prime aesthetics. Started planning my next visit mid-way through the first bite. I would recommend to anyone as the best donuts in CLE. Honestly, this is a short review because the flavors speak for themselves. From the July 2020 menu: Strawberry shortcake, lemon lavender, cookies and cream, 2 x Boston creme, and blueberry cake. If you are decisive--unlike me in this shop--and only want to try one, the Boston creme or blueberry cake would be IT.",1
Best donuts in Cleveland!!!! Their flavors are always amazing and totally worth the drive if you don't live in the area. I live on the East side but have absolutely no issue making the drive because these donuts are incredible. And the sisters that own the place are the sweetest! They are frequently joined by their parents who help out at the shop who are equally nice :) I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this donut shop is. My only complaint is that I wish they were opened 7 days a week so that I could go every day!,1
"literally the best place ever. doughnuts are so good- even to people who are not vegan! mornings are really busy and there is usually a 20+ minute line, and holidays can have up to hour long waits, so plan when you will go wisely(10-closing there is typically no line but flavors may be sold out). CHECK THEIR INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK BEFORE YOU GO! they often sell out, and occasionally announce closures day-of. i go once a month to tryout the monthly menu items, and although my body weight doesn't thank me, my taste buds certainly do!",1
The traditional glazed twist is spectacular and the kids loved the cotton candy donuts. Prepare for a line and a wait but it's well worth it!,1
So so good! You don't have to be vegan to love these donuts!!!,1
"I just went to this amazing place for the first time. I am definitely not vegan, but always been curious about trying their donuts. They always have a long line when I drive pass them and now I understand why people would wait a while for a donut. I was really surprised on how much I enjoyed the donuts and would definitely get the Cotton Candy donut again!!! I am definitely going to be going back again sometime in the future!",1
"Do not miss an opportunity to eat a donut from The Vegan Doughnut Company. Hands down the best donuts I've ever eaten in my life. You can't go wrong with pretty much any flavor. There is often a long line out the door on weekend mornings, but I promise these donuts are absolutely worth the wait. Can't wait to go back (again) and try more flavors.",1
"Vegan heaven!!!! Happy to see these lovely ladies have there own shop up and running now!!! They have so many options we got the Boston cream, cookie dough and the glaze twist. Our favorite was the classic glazed twist. It was amazing!!! The other 2 were really good but something about a glazed donut makes me happy. Love love love!!!",1
"Totally worth the drive out to Lakewood - even considering going back next weekend. These doughnuts taste beyond amazing, and you'd never know they're vegan if you're a non-vegan such as myself. Honestly, I was inspired to come here because the doughnuts looked so pretty, and they taste as good as they look. Pictured here are the strawberry shortcake, cookie dough, maple creme, and chocolate with sprinkles from their August menu. I was sad that they had already run out of the blueberry cake by the time we got there, but the cookie dough and strawberry were definite favorites. A couple friends also got and highly endorsed the lemon lavender, which apparently tastes exactly as advertised. They're employing safe Covid measures as well - only one party of customers allowed in the building at a time and masks are required (obvi). The space is super small, so this is really appreciated. If you're in the mood for a sweet treat for breakfast, look no further. But do get there early! There was a line down the block by 10:30 and they've been known to sell out before noon on busy days. Final pro-tip: there's a parking lot in the back so you don't have to park on the street. Tldr: totally recommend, but get there early if you can!",1
Very good doughnuts. A bit more expensive than I would have imagined but worth the trip and our family enjoyed them. I really appreciate having a vegan option in Cleveland. Thanks for being here!,1
"So amazing!!! As someone with lots of dietary restrictions, it's always so hard to find vegan sweets, especially readily available! The food is phenomenal, I've had non-vegan friends try the donuts that don't taste anything different compared to a regular one. Not to mention the owner and workers there are so freaking nice, it's hard not to love this place. :)",1
"Delicious donuts -- would highly recommend! Due to COVID they are only allowing 1 party enter at a time, but at Saturday at 12 PM there was only 1 party ahead of us and we only had to wait about 5 minutes. The staff was so friendly and I was happy to see that all the flavors were still available at noon. I tried the pumpkin donut and it was amazing!",1
This is a great alternative for those who are not able to eat traditional donuts! Being a big fan of donuts I made it a goal to try donuts from every donut shop in the Northeast Ohio area. I was skeptical when I saw that these were donuts that were completely vegan. I could tell that these donuts were a bit different from traditional donuts but they are still a great alternate. There isn't much flavor as traditional donuts but it's still something I would recommend checking out. I am a fan of the unique options and the shape of the donuts. If you're looking for something different then I would give this vegan joint a try,1
"These are the best doughnuts ever made. Non-vegan wouldn't know the difference. They are delicious: great texture, the dough's consistency is excellent, and the flavor profiles are dynamic yet classic. Well done!!! I wish this business nothing but success!",1
"The BEST vegan donuts that I have ever tried. They have both cake donuts and regular donuts. Their flavors are so unique, and I was excited to try their fall flavors: pumpkin spice, maple cream, and apple cider. All were amazing!!! Luckily, I did not experience a wait. Their hours are limited, so check before you go!",1
"I am not vegan. Yet somehow these are my favorite donuts in the world. I moved to Texas a year ago and I still find myself dreaming about these donuts. I have tried every donut shop in Cleveland and no one can compare to Vegan Doughnut Company's maple cream filled or glazed twist. If you are hesitant about going here for donuts because they're vegan let me enlighten and encourage you. The texture of all of their donuts are heavenly, the flavors can't be compared. The glaze may be a little runnier than Krispy Kreme but it is delicious. GO HERE!!!!!",1
Our favorite doughnut place around! I love the lavender lemonade one and the cookie dough. The texture is fluffy and chewy- the flavors pop and are not too sweet.,1
Super cute and modern. Doughnuts are very big and pretty. And the taste.. nothing compares,1
This place is incredible. Follow their instagram to see their current menu and when they're open. You'll never run out of delicious donuts to try - but I have to say their old fashioned is my favorite. The donuts are light and fluffy and have the perfect sweetness. The only caveat is that you have to go early - the lines can get long especially around holidays and weekends and they do run out of donuts!,1
I have been stalking this place on Instagram waiting for them to open the brick and mortar store. It finally happened and it took me forever to get here but it was worth the wait! The decor is light and airy. Plants decorate the space and natural light give it a welcoming ambiance. The young lady who helped us (I'm assuming that it was one of the sisters) was so friendly so was the man who greeted us. I chose the strawberry shortcake donut and the lemon lavender donut. My sisters both chose chocolate glazed and cookies and cream. They loved them!! My 3 year old niece ate her donut and most of her aunts donut then asked for another! The donuts are very moist but not greasy. Truly flavorful not just sweet! Having lactose intolerance and other food I may have to make the drive from Shaker whenever I get a taste for a donut! Back for another vegan donut hit! Today I tried the apple cider cake donut and it was delicious! I also learned that they substitute water in place of milk and applesauce in place of egg! You wouldn't know it because the texture and flavor of their donuts is amazing! Keep up the great work!,1
"Legit my new favorite doughnuts. Better than any I've had. Fluffy like Krispy Kreme, but truly better flavors. I came in on Thanksgiving (god bless you all for being open) and even though they were low on stock, I had some pretty fabulous options. Pumpkin, Cherry Pie, lemon lavender, and chocolate sprinkles. INCREDIBLE. I've never had such flavorful, lightly sweet, perfectly crafted donuts in my life. The space itself is super cute, and the women who work there are wonderful. Kind, polite, enthusiastic. I called about 45 min after I left to ask about ingredients because my friend has a cashew allergy, and they happily looked it up for me and confirmed no cashews in their ingredients. Mostly soy based, FYI. So bright and friendly on the phone and appreciated the time she took to make sure she got me the right info. 10/10 would recommend A+ donuts, cannot wait to go back and get some more. It's dangerous that I live five minutes away but I'm also not mad about it ;)",1
"I've been waiting for their store front to open and they didn't disappoint!! I'm personally not a vegan but enjoy some good vegan food. These donuts are AMAZING! I love their unique square shape and the wide range of flavors offered. Can't wait to stop by again soon! Welcome to the neighborhood, Vegan Doughnut Company!!",1
"The Vegan Donut Company is a m a z i n g! I can't say enough great things about them. Customer service- Kyra and Kharisma are quite possibly the sweetest business owners I've ever met. They are friendly, proud of their work, and most of all seem to exude a grateful attitude in every way possible. I've visited their store front to just buy a few donuts but I've also made a custom order of over 100 for a work event and they are such a joy to work with. Taste- the old fashioned donut is better than almost any cake like donut I've had EVER. Cake donuts are my favorite, so this is a big deal for me. Amazing, just try one. Vegan donuts? I'm not a vegan but enjoy a lot of vegan foods. My boyfriend on the other hand is the furthest thing away from vegan that you could probably imagine. When I gave him his first Vegan Donut Co donut he said they were better than another very popular, trendy donut place in cleveland, and a week later he asked me if we could go back because he's craving some Vegan Donut Co. Kudos, ladies! The only reason I'm at 4 starts instead of 5 is *somtimes* the donuts can be really greasy. The last box of 4 I got had a grease stain on the whole bottom of the box after a few hours. This may just be on the outside of the donuts, because when you bite into them you don't get a mouth full of grease like the dough soaked it up. So, I'm not sure what's going on there or if it was just a off day for me, but the Vegan Donut Co is such a winner for vegans and non vegans alike.",1
"If this is what all of being vegan tastes like, sign me up (lol it's not, and don't). But these are possibly THE most flavorful doughnuts I've ever had - as in real, fresh, natural ingredient flavor, not just fried sugar bomb flavor (although there's a time and place for that too). We visited the first day they re-opened after the COVID-19 closure - aaaand they were sold out. So we returned the next weekend and waited in line for about 30 minutes before finally getting our chance. It's a clean and simple interior with lots of big pretty plants, a menu board, and a counter with all the fresh goodies lined up and waiting to be eaten! When we walked in, the trays for two of the flavors we wanted most were empty. We're so used to this happening (see: Brewnuts) but UNLIKE Brewnuts they had more ready in the back within 2 minutes. It's almost like they anticipated which flavors would be popular and planned ahead so that customers wouldn't leave disappointed. I appreciate that so much! Staff were very friendly and efficient too. Way to do business! We tried the maple cream, lemon lavender, blueberry cake, strawberry shortcake, banana pudding, and old fashioned cake. There wasn't a bad or even mediocre one in the bunch. These are very light and fluffy doughnuts, not heavy or dense at all. And again, the flavors are so fresh and well done that it really put them over the top. The maple cream was the sweetest of the bunch, and my husband and I both agreed that the strawberry shortcake was our favorite. We can't wait to come back and try more of their amazing flavors. Support black-owned businesses!",1
The best donuts on the west side of Cleveland! The revolving menu is fantastic. My favorites so far have been the strawberry creme filling and cookies & cream. The staff/owners are always so nice as well. Highly recommend!,1
"Wow! These doughnuts are utterly delicious! I have been eating dairy and soy free for a couple of months now and have found it challenging to find good desserts, especially chocolate. My mom gifted me a box of these amazing treats for my birthday and I was blown away by the flavors and quality of the doughnuts. Even if you're not vegan, you need to check this place out. You won't regret it - sooo yummy!!",1
"I was have a vegan day, so this doughnut shop popped up and I was super excited to try it! And let me tell you it's just as good as non vegan doughnuts. The shop is so cute and they have a great verity, my kids loved them as well. We'll definitely be going back.",1
"This place is awesome! I had a glazed twist doughnut, and it was served to me warm. It was like going to Krispy Kreme when the light is on, but better. The dough is chewy and soft and perfectly flavored. I don't normally eat sweets, but I'd driven by and wondered about this place. The indulgence was well worth it. The person I visited with is not a vegan, and felt just as satisfied as I was. It's always nice when choosing a vegan option doesn't require a sacrifice of taste or quality. Two thumbs up, Vegan Doughnut Company!",1
"I don't think you understand how excited I am that Vegan Doughnuts finally has it's own place! I first tried their donuts at Night Market a few years ago and since then have sought them out at Night Market, at the Cleveland Flea, pretty much anywhere they popped up. I've tried several of their donuts but my favorite out of all those is, and always will be, the lemon lavender one. If you haven't had it yet, wait no further and go get one. My family hadn't had them before so I picked up two lemon lavender, a Boston cream, a cookie dough, a cookies & cream and a s'mores one. The interior of this place is cute and they're currently open Friday-Sunday during specific hours (checking their Facebook page is your best bet). They have a few standard flavors and then a few they rotate (their Facebook page is your friend to see what they're offering that day). $3 for a donut might seem a bit much but considering the quality, the size and the density (not too dense but you won't want more than one...MAYBE two if it's that sort of day...), it's worth it. I'm excited to come back and try the flavors I haven't had yet!",1
"My boss had been raving about this place for months so we had to try it. We are not vegan, heck we aren't even vegetarians but wanted to try something new. The donuts were delicious. We tried the glazed twist, blueberry cake, and apple cider. The store opens at 9am on weekends but we didn't get there until after 11am so most of their selection was sold out. My daughter, 11, LOVED her twist donut, having no idea that it wasn't a ""regular"" donut. The blueberry cake donut was sweet while not being over whelming. The donuts themselves were very light and not dense or heavy. I was very pleasantly surprised. Definitely will be back to try the tiramisu and oatmeal cookie dough, the flavors change monthly so we will have to go sooner than later.",1
"Donut ask me about my diet! Actually, do ask, because I've been munching on the most mouth-watering vegan doughnuts! That's right, a plant-based version of this delicious treat. While these doughnuts do not contain dairy or eggs, you'll still get lost in the amazing flavors, forgetting that these are vegan to begin with. The Vegan Doughnut Company is serving up a variety of super light, fluffy, and pillowy doughnuts, covered with fresh toppings, filled with strawberry, maple, or boston cream, made from wholesome ingredients, which make them utterly irresistible. From the popular glazed twist, to lemon lavender, you'll want to sink your teeth in. Whether you like your donuts plain or dipped, they have a wide selection that will please your taste buds. They even have chocolate sprinkled to remind you just how good the childhood classic really is. If you want to be impressed, order the strawberry shortcake--IMO it's easily the best doughnut I have ever had! The toppings alone will make you drool. Sweeten up your day with a deluxe sweet treat from The Vegan Doughnut Company. The doughnuts go fast, so get there early to snag the best flavors. I can not recommend this place enough! <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FSincerelybs.com&s=02a0e1d68263c14c0dd58132bf7feba8549331742830e3958cfae58bc52501f8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Sincerelybs.com</a>",1
"Picked up 2 dozen donuts this morning to share with family. I have a dairy allergy so I'm always excited to find treats that I can indulge in! Tried the blueberry, strawberry with sprinkles, lemon lavender, Boston Cream, glazed and chocolate with sprinkles. My favorites were the strawberry and chocolate. The ladies who waited on me this morning (mom and daughter) were very friendly. Donuts were good...I probably won't spend $48 on donuts again anytime soon.",1
"I used to drive to Indy for a Long's donut (Google them), but since I've found this jewel I can stay home and drive up the street. Great donuts.",1
"The best donuts I've ever had in my life. Everyone I've introduced these donuts to has said the same thing. Obsessed with the simple glazed twists that they have pretty much every day, but also love some of the fancier ones too: Creme filled, s'mores, lavender, YUM. EVERYONE needs to go here. If I lived closer I'd probably go every weekend. & they offer a discount if you bring your own container!!",1
"Awesome donuts! Been getting their donuts since they were a popup. Really fresh, great variety, delicious, and super nice owners. Best vegan (or any) donuts ever!!",1
"Such a cute little doughnut shop!!! The doughnuts were delicious and totally vegan.I came in with the intention to buy 1 doughnut, and ended up leaving with 4. Each one better than the last. Lemon lavender, chocolate sprinkles, strawberry shortcake I believe, and cookies and cream. Light, fluffy and not to sweet. Great for vegans and non vegans alike, I'll definitely be back.",1
"Love the donuts and I'm not even vegan. The service was great also! My recommendation if someone says this is their first time in - offer suggestions or get to know the customer a little. Especially when they look a little indecisive about all the options. Also, the location is wonderful, the interior is amazing! I'd turn the music up a little bit to create that vibe. I went on a Sunday morning so maybe what's why but I'd love to hear some good tunes! I'll be back to try all the flavors!!",1
"A coworker just brought donuts from this place, the s'mores donut is delicious! Great flavor",1
"GOURMET CAKE & PASTRIES AT ITS FINEST! The Butterwood Bake Consortium is one of my favorite places to stop for dessert if I'm in the city. The shop has this super cool vintage speakeasy type of vibe and the cake and dessert assortments are incredible. This is not just a place you go for a slice of chocolate cake, however, no, no.... These flavors are anything but ordinary - pictured here: Lavender cake with agave buttercream. Or how about Rose Poppy seed with a vanilla frosting? Olive oil cake with a orange honey icing, brown butter blondies with a cinnamon/sugar ""pixie dust"" topping. And these are just to name a few I saw last night. The flavors and assortments change every time I go, and I promise they never disappoint and are all ""melt in your mouth"" Incredible! Bonus: they also are open late and have wonderful coffee and tea options to go alongside your dessert! It's the perfect evening spot after a nice dinner if your in the city/Lawrenceville area!",1
"Stopped in for the first time last night. Was a cute way to end date night. The vibes are chill AF and the aesthetic is very vintage living room meets comfy-cozy coffee shop. It was very lowkey and quiet - couple people were even reading books peacefully while enjoying their pastries. Everyone was very nice and the items were well priced. We didn't try their coffee because it was 9pm but it all looked good. We ordered an earl grey parfait cake to split. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasnt overwhelming sweet as some dessert shops are. It was the perfect balance of flavor and subtle sweetness. My GF who doesn't like cake (i know, i know) even enjoyed it which is saying something! Definitely recommend this place for a cute date, me-time, or a chill friend meet up. Also their cakes looked delicious and were so beautiful, for sure would consider purchasing if I ever need one for an event!",1
"Wow this place is a gem. Inviting, beautifully decorated and amazing selections of baked goods. Great for an intimate meeting place, remote working space or writing. Street parking is in front of the bakery.",1
"Visited the BBC for the first time a few weeks ago for a late-night treat with friends, and it was delightful! This place has been on my list to visit for years now, and I'm sorry I waited so long - their cakes are incredible! I tried a slice of orange poppy cake and it was moist, flavorful, not too sweet, and incredibly balanced in textures and elements. They had so many interesting options to choose from, it was so difficult to decide on just one dessert! Many of their offerings are vegan, too, just as a PSA! I'd love to get one of these cakes for a birthday gift or a special occasion, and for all my future late night sweet tooth cravings. I would be remiss not to mention that the staff member serving us that night was unceasingly kind, patient, and so helpful despite the busy line of patrons. My hope is that this place is around for many years to come! I can't wait to return!",1
"Cake by the slice? Yes, please! I just love this place. It was an old staple of mine when it first opened, but I haven't been able to stop by as often recently. I popped in this afternoon to pick up a birthday treat for a friend. It was packed! Lots of people enjoying yummy cakes. A favorite of my family is the brown butter blondie - they almost always have them. I enjoy that the cakes are always rotating and you can try tons of fun combos.",1
"When you walk in here your eyes are gonna be all over scanning the walls, decor, and the adorable selection of cakes. They're almost too pretty to eat!",1
I haven't been to Butterwood in awhile but was driving past it and decided to stop for a sweet treat to take home. I was going to get a slice of cake but saw this adorable tea cake (I bought two different ones but only took a photo of one!) and decided to get. It was the perfect bite size for breakfast with my latte. I highly recommend BBC for any treats. Note: I'm not sure if the frosting is vegan but many of the cake based are.,1
"I loved this cafe! They have a wonderful variety of cakes and treats to go along with your coffee / tea. The staff was friendly and the space is great to relax. Being there on a Friday night, we were surprised how busy it got throughout the time we sat in the cafe. Being open late it is a great space to go for after dinner tea and dessert. I tried the butterscotch pudding (delicious!), had a hot tea with plenty of water refills, and got a blondie to go. Love it - will be back next time I'm in Lawrenceville!",1
"It's been a minute since I visited the Butterwood Bake consortium but man oh man, do I dream about this place at night! The ambiance is awesome. The cake is delicious. Overall 5/5 and definitely recommend to check out if you're in Upper Lawrenceville looking for a sweet treat! Parking in upper Lawrenceville tends to be easier than mid-lower part of the neighborhood. And if I'm not mistaken there is a parking lot next to Butterwood, so if it's open you can pull in and park very easily. Prices are on the higher side, but this is delicious freaking cake! It's definitely a fun treat to grab with a friend or loved one.",1
"Run, don't walk to get their vegan blueberry oat crumble! We arrived at about 9:30pm after a soccer game. Most of their stuff was sold out, but I managed to snag two vegan tea cakes and as an after thought, the blueberry crumble. The tea cakes were delicate and delicious. I had the crumble this morning with my coffee and I could not stop eating it until it was gone! Really glad we stopped by this adorable bakery last night and we'll definitely be back the next time we come through Pittsburgh.",1
"Lovely and quaint sweet shop! The interior was so cute... Their selection mostly consisted of cakes and I got the raspberry jasmine cake with honey buttercream frosting. When I took the first bite, I felt the cake was very moist and thick. I really couldn't get the flavors. It was a huge piece, so I boxed it up. After leaving it at room temperature for sometime, the frosting felt so tasty and so the the cake. The prices are slightly on the expensive side. For example, a bottle of pellegrino was $4. Nevertheless, it wouldn't hurt to try this spot.",1
"I've known of The Butterwood Bake Consortium for quite a long time, but as a South Hills girl, this particular spot is a bit out of my way. Finally, I remembered to poke my head in and pick up some treats when I was passing through the area this weekend. Obviously I couldn't enjoy the full Butterwood experience in 2020, but I got to enjoy the important part: the cake! Butterwood is a dessert cafe, meaning they specialize in some of our favorite sweets - think cake, pie, and brownies. Coffee and tea are also served here, so in any year other than 2020, this would be the greatest spot to meet up with friends and catch up. While the dine-in experience is hard/impossible to enjoy right now for reasons beyond Butterwood's control, I can confirm that their desserts are still fabulous. I recently picked up several tea cakes to take home and sample. One was a lavender rose cake with fig buttercream; another was a dark chocolate cake with peanut butter buttercream; and the last was a ginger tea cake. The ginger cake, while good, was actually the ""disappointing"" one out of the bunch (I use the term loosely because again: all were good). I say that because chocolate and peanut butter always go well together and because the lavender-rose-fig combo is out of this world delicious. I did not expect that one to be my favorite, but here we are! A little more about the cake here: on their website they say, ""We bake with organic Beehive Flour, Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Multiple Organics Brand Cocoa Powder, and local butter, cream, and organic eggs, all sourced from Frankferd Farms Organic Foods."" Sounds good, right? Bonus points because Butterwood also serves up gluten-free desserts; in fact, my friends who eat gluten-free diets are the people who sing the loudest praise for this little cafe. While 2020 has sadly kept me from comfortably sitting and enjoying the full cozy cafe experience, Butterwood's baked goods are still fantastic and can always be enjoyed at home. Treat yourself this holiday season and stop in to pick up a delectable dessert - you won't be disappointed!",1
"I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I thought I wasn't much of a dessert person. It turns out I'm just very discerning and this place sets the bar so high! Seriously, if you've ever wondered about what your last meal request would be, look no further. You cannot go wrong here. The sweets are divine and perfectly pairable with exquisite teas or coffees. The atmosphere is romantic, intellectual, sophisticated yet not pretentious, and old world. I had the cinnamon pixie dust blondie with cinnamon apple herbal tea. My daughter had the lavender olive oil cake with agave buttercream and jasmine rose tea. There are lots of vegan and some gluten-free options, clean ingredients too. Treat yourself or take a friend you love very much. Swoon worthy indeed.",1
"A perfect place to put on your AirPods, do homework, and eat some yummy desserts. Raspberry Rose Cake with Raspberry Buttercream- One of the best cakes I have ever eaten. The flavors of rose and raspberry came through so well and wasn't alarmingly sweet. Although it was on the sweet side, I was still able to finish it. This would definitely taste better with some tea though! Raspberry Jasmine Cake with Honey Buttercream- Definitely on the sweet side. I think the honey buttercream made it too sweet. However, the flavors were delicious though I didn't taste the jasmine at all. Still amazing nonetheless. Overall, I would come back and try their mini cakes over their cake slices!",1
"Hands down my favorite vegan bakery in Pittsburgh! The cutest decor, exquisite flavors and delicious cake! The staff was super kind and helpful, ans even though it was quite expensive, it is definitely worth it!",1
"Coffee and tea in a city that warrants coffee and tea - part 2 of 2 I admit to eating the same sandwich (the Vito - #5) that I always eat at Jimmy John's while I was in Pittsburgh, since there's a Jimmy John's located right outside the T (light rail) station in the city center. However, that was not going to deter me from wanting to find at least one more funky indie coffeehouse that offered either sweet or savory stuff to woof down along with a good cup of tea. This place wasn't recommended. I found it via a Yelp search. First, it's ButterWOOD. It's not ButterWORTH. Don't be coming here looking for pancake syrup. What it is (yeah, what it is, man) is the merging of a bakery and a coffee/tea shop. And the combination works. Let's get right to the desserts. They have traditional cakes, muffins, cupcakes, scones, and the like in various flavors. They are baked on the premises using healthy premium ingredients. In this way, they can satisfy all those health food crazed individuals via GF, vegan, and all those stipulations. For me, this can water down the potentially decadent (fine with me) taste of baked goods, but they were still very good. I also learned that vegan is pronounced ""vee-guhn."" I've always pronounced it as if someone was a Chevy Vega jockey. Then, this place, ButterWOOD, is hilarious on so many levels. They have bordello-like Victorian furnishings inside, complete with red velvet seating and those sorts of accessories befitting a whore house right out of the Wild West. It's in a funky area named Lawrenceville, which might have been on the decline in the past but the earthy-crunchy crowd has deemed it worth rescuing. Now, if earthy-crunchy types throw out attitude, and many of them do, I don't care for them. However, if they're affable and provide good customer service, I can overlook the demographic chasm. Here, the progressive employees and ownership are indeed nice folks. It is priced a little high. That's because they merge a specialty cake shop with the coffeehouse aspect. If not for that, ButterWOOD would get 5 stars. Maybe 4 stars is a better rating in this case because it aligns with the 4 word expression: ""let them eat cake."" It is a unique experience and their goods are good, so check it out at least once. I visited twice.",1
The store is gorgeoussssssssssss! I'm so glad I had an opportunity to stop by! The girl who worked there is beyond informative and wonderful. Everything is aesthetically appealing and delicious! Cakes are sold by slice only so make sure you call 24-48 hours in advance!!,1
"I really liked the bakery decor and reminded me very much of NYC. Unfortunately we got there when there was only one vegan dessert option (would've liked to have been able to try a couple more). However, this blueberry cobbler was to die for so I'm not mad . Do stop in for a tasty treat!",1
"The Butterwood Bake Consortium is a gem of a place and exactly the sort of spot Upper Lawrenceville was lacking. Only a year ago there weren't any good places to grab coffee or tea and pastries past 52nd street. With this covering desserts, coffee, and tea and the nearby B52 cafe, the area is lacking no longer. I came here with a friend who had been wanting to try it with me. I arrived a bit earlier than she did and was greeted by the lovely woman behind the counter. I ordered a vegan blackberry vanilla cake and inquired about the tea options. She let me smell the different types of tea, and I chose the peppermint which I thought would be light enough to pair with the cake. The chestnut tea smelled excellent, and I will be back to try some with a dark chocolate dessert. I sat at one of the Victorian garden style tables, and my order was brought out to me in under five minutes. The cake had been warmed up and the tea came with a little timer for steeping. Everything tasted delicious! By this time my friend had arrived and selected chocolate mouse and an espresso. She felt much the same about the quality of her dessert. I was offered more water for a second cup of tea, and we sat and chatted for over an hour as the place became progressively more full and lively. (There was even a book club!) I loved seeing how much people were enjoying themselves. Dessert here is going to be a regular occurrence!",1
"When I was in Pittsburgh I always visited this place and would get my birthday cake there... well today's my birthday and I was thinking about how badly I wanted a slice (but I am in Mississippi) and thus I will reminisce. It is thebest cake I have had..hands down...I love the awesome blend of flavors and the buttercream frosting is to die for! Their coffee and their one of a kind hot chocolate make for a perfect pairing with a slice of cake. Update: made it back to the burgh for one day and I just had to make it back to the Butterwood. It is just the perfect place to study (with the nicest staff), grab a coffee and a slice of cake!",1
It's a very cute place with beautiful cakes. The cream/frosting was a tad too sweet for my taste and the flavors were either a hit or a miss. I got the blood orange cupcake (barely tasted the blood orange) and the pumpkin cake with espresso cream. It had two strong flavors that didn't really complement each other well. But the texture of both were great - the cake was moist and soft! I also tasted some of the poppyseed cake which had a more gentle and subtle flavor. This is a great place to chat and hang around and hopefully the cakes I choose next time will be better.,1
I was a little apprehensive to try here after reading reviews about dry cakes but decided to give it a go and boy was I happy I did! People don't know what their talking about. The cakes are phenomenal. I think people are confusing density with dryness. These cakes are moist as heck and come in such neat flavors! Coffee is also very good. We split the brownie which was massive and rich as well as the earl gray and black raspberry butter cream tea cake WOW SO SO good!!!,1
"Relaxing tea and pastry spot, with a good selection of sweet little pastries to try (vegan options as well). The atmosphere is quiet and eclectic. The tea was excellent.",1
"From the outside it looks like every other coffee shop, crisp white and a contemporary feel. Inside is such a delightful surprise. Their cakes/coffee are just as surprising. The decoration and artistry that goes into their desserts are a match for their taste! Absolutely beautiful (almost too beautiful to eat) and just as delicious. Trust me you'll be ecstatic if you stop in! Also they are BYOB, AND OPENED UNTIL 11!",1
"Do you deserve some decadent elegance? Maybe some Victorian decor and huge slices of delicious cake? You are surely in the right place! I love the concept of a late night dessert place, and I think the decor works perfectly. It's similar to an elegant tea room, and a good place for conversation and fun. I got the cinnamon rosemary cake with vanilla buttercream. It's a little savory and just enough sweet. My friend got a blonde, which is like a vanilla brownie. I like that it's served warm. I've never experienced them running out of desserts, so perhaps they are planning better. I like everything about this place, and I think you will, too.",1
"A solid spot in Lawrenceville. Went here because two of my friends had their wedding cake from here (it was great!). The space itself is cool, they have an eclectic style of decor inside. They have a nice variety of offerings, some a little strange, but overall I think most people could find something here. They also have some great beverage options (coffee, espresso, etc.). I had the blueberry rose cake with vanilla buttercream. Their icing is fantastic but the cake was a little dry for my liking. Prices are a little steep. Would definitely try this place again.",1
This place always has unique vegan options. And there is always more than one. Yesterday there were four vegan options and I had never had them before. This is the best variety in town and we go there for almost everyone in the family's birthday.,1
"If cake was as healthy as vegetables, I would have cake from Butterwood for breakfast everyday. I've never tried a flavor I didn't like. The frosting is my favorite part!",1
"No matter how many times I go here there's always something new to try! The flavors are so unique (lavender, rose, figs, etc.). The only downside is it's pricy and there's not a lot of room to sit (nor outlets if you're trying to do work).",1
"It's like I went into The Secret Garden and discovered beautiful, tasty and decadent delights that were made just for my princess palate! This bakery and cafe is BEAUTIFUL! When you enter you're met with a lovely Shabby Chic decor and a comfortable, but lovely, cafe to sit and relax and think pretty thoughts. Then you go further in and the lovely bakery items behind glass tempt with the sheer prettiness of it all. The cakes, and cupcakes and pastries were absolutely amazing! I had a mini cake that was a Sage cake with Prickly Pear Agave and Fresh Cream. Impressive, right?!!! The taste was beyond this world. The cake was light and moist, the frosting was also light and not too sweet. Impressive. I paired it with a Peach Mint ice tea and sat down on the lovely antique sofa, browsed through table books they supplied and was in my own world of Cafe and Bakery decadence and I don't know if it can be surpassed! I really urge anyone reading this to take a ride to Butterwood Cake Consortium in Lawrenceville on Butler St. and you can thank me later!!!",1
Amazingly beautiful cakes and pastries in a lovely space. Lovely people too. Parking lot adjacent.,1
"Was scrambling to look for a bakery in the area and this popped up. Been driving pass this place so many times and never knew that they existed. This place has a very unique selection (in terms of flavors) of cupcakes, cakes, parfait, baked pastries and brownies. I adore their modern and rustic buttercream designs. I also appreciate that they offer gluten free options. I gotta say, if you're looking for plain vanilla, this place is not for you. I got 6/7 items from here. They're a good mix of cupcakes, pies and brownies. The buttercream on the cupcakes are delicious! Not overly sweet yet very light. If you're a fan of blueberries, try their blueberry oatmeal crumble. Otherwise, you won't go wrong with their chocolate brownies. It's one of the best brownies I've tasted!",1
"I had been on the hunt to find a cafe that serves slices of cake with a nice atmosphere such as this one (in pittsburgh it's not so easy to find) and I was set to try it out! I got the buttermilk fig cake with honey pistachio buttercream along with the hibiscus passion fruit iced tea. The cakes look so presentable in the case and it was so difficult to choose one, but it seemed the most interesting to me. This was a good dense cake, but after a while, the buttercream was getting too salty for me--it might have been better to get a coffee to compliment the taste. Also, $6+tax per slice may be a bit steep for some but slices can be shared too. There is plenty of seating throughout the inside and outside (back patio), and there are velvet couches along the wall with all the fancy plates attached to it. This is a good environment to have long chats to catch up and there is likely to be room to sit. It is likely to be decent place to study as well, although I don't think there are outlets. They also play their fantastical soundtracks not at a simply quiet volume so keep that in mind as well.",1
"Service was friendly-ish, prices are pretty high and was bummed that they weren't accepting cash. Cakes are nice, but wouldn't return for one. However, those peanut butter cookie sandwiches are amazing. Cookies are a little salty and have the right amount of crunch. The PB butter cream IS perfectly peanut butter-y. Bring those to any event and people will LOVE them and love you for bringing them. Would definitely return for more of these sandwiches in the future.",1
Vegan options are absolutely delicious! $13 for 3 cupcakes is a bit expensive but the flavor is worth it over going to a chain bakery,1
"I love this place for so many reasons! It was within walking distance of my old apartment, making it dangerously easy to pick up a few treats every so often. I love that they are open late! This is the most perfect after dinner dessert date spot. They are open until 11 pm on the weekends. You can stop in to grab a few desserts for breakfast the next morning, or sit and share a slice of cake in their romantic and dimly lit lounge area. We have ordered their tea cakes and full size cakes for my friend that is vegan. Everyone always enjoys it, even if they don't know that it's vegan. Their flavors are so unique and you won't find anything like these desserts anywhere else. My favorites are the blueberry rose cake with fig cream olive oil love cake and the lavender tea cake with blackberry buttercream. The blondie bars are also to die for. They serve great coffee and espresso drinks too. They used to have a few tables outside in the back, but I'm not sure if they still do or not. This place is beautiful, and so are their desserts. Definitely check this place out especially for a special celebration!",1
"After having dinner with two friends we were all in need of a sweet treat. A quick Yelp search in our area lead us here. We each (of course) decided on different cakes: pear, fig, and chocolate peanut butter. Naturally, we ordered one of each. With the addition of a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is the REAL DEAL and not to be missed! All in all, the experience was fabulous. Each cake was amazing, the hot chocolate was rich but perfectly creamy, and the dark ambiance was edgy but inviting. If all that wasn't enough, Butterwood is open late (perfect for late night cravings)!",1
"Quaint stop for deliciously moist cake & rich coffee. If near this area, add this to your list. Even the flavor combinations were special.",1
"The desserts here lived up to the hype! The cake we got wasn't too sweet, the sweetness was perfect, and the slice was huge. The service was great, and I would definitely go back especially since it's open late and has a cute interior decor.",1
"This is a beautiful Victoria posh dessert bar with comfy seating. They have about 5 cakes to pick from and some small desserts. My 8 layer strawberry cream cake was delicious and they are open late night for dessert and coffee! The only draw back is they are far from the main action, you will have to drive here, it's past the cemetary. I hope they build more stores in this area.",1
"Their vegan cake is pretty good! I'm allergic to dairy and can't have regular cake, so I always appreciate it when there's somewhere nearby with vegan desserts. It's not the best vegan cake I've had, but it's pretty good.",1
"On today's Lawrenceville cookie tour I made it a point to hike nearly 10 blocks from my car to find this place. It is very small and quaint. They have a relaxed seating area in the front with a few comfortable chairs and tables. In the back were all your dessert offerings. I asked the person who waited on me what her recommendation was and she said everything. Well that leaves me with one option. Look and see what little is left and chances are I would get a winner. They are all priced at $6.00 but the slices are enormous! I saw the cinnamon cake was gone so I opted for what they call the vanilla black sesame cake with chocolate buttercream.Never tried anything like that before but it's different so I went with it. The lady brought the slice to my table and it was to die for! Every bite you can taste the sesame seeds and it was very rich! I learned that take out is available as well and of course you can purchase whole cakes if you are inclined to do so. I really felt like I was eating a gigantic piece from one of the more popular chain restaurants. I was so stuffed from eating it that I was glad I had the 10 blocks to head back to my car to ""burn"" some of it off. The cake shop is located near Allegheny Cemetery and it is easy to miss if you don't check the house numbers. Next time I'll get a box to take half of it home!",1
"My husband and I loved this place. Though we couldn't sit inside (they only had to-go items available due to Covid), the ambience was incredible and we really wish we could have enjoyed it more. It seemed like one of those entertaining rooms in old timey Great Gatsby era. Red velvet couches, antique furniture, warm yellow lighting, beautiful rich fabrics everywhere! Butterwood had an incredible selection of pastries and cakes that you wouldn't even believe, and numerous vegan options to boot. We ended up going with: - The Poppy Rose Cake with Fig Cream - Carrot Spice Cake with Cinnamon Espresso Buttercream - Blood Orange Almond Cake with Almond Buttercream All were absolutely fantastic - we shared with my cousin and his gf - and the crowd favorite was the Poppy Rose Cake which was moist, delicious, and had the perfect subtle notes of poppy and rose that went excellently together. We also had two small hot chocolates. The hot chocolates were very average, would not waste your time with them. Just get more of the chewable sweet treats instead! Five stars despite the hot chocolate because it really was JUST that good.",1
Updating this review and adding a star because I came back twice in one weekend for the earl grey tea cake with chocolate buttercream. Service was excellent both times!,1
Shabby chic with unusual ingredients. Delightful. Lemon curd tart with blueberry icing. Lemon cake with blueberry frosting. Pavlova with fresh berries. Chocolate cake with cinnamon. Blondies and chocolate brownies. Standing in front of the 5' dessert case was similiar to standing at a nursery window at a hospital. Everyone was oooh and aaah-ing. Desserts are served on antique mismatched plates. Get a to go order just for the packaging and wooden forks. Outdoor seating is available. Street parking. Definitely requires a return visit.,1
"Love this place. Cakes and other delights have always been great. Service is nice too. My only complaint is that since this not a coffee shop where you drink/eat and go, people tend to stay for long periods of time and seating space is limited. Hence, forcing me to get things to go.",1
"Update- So pleased that this hidden gem has managed to stay open. While it is takeout only, on a nice day there is a patio in back where you can enjoy your desserts. As always, everything was beautifully made and delicious, though the selection was more limited than usual. Always vegan options, if that is your thing.",1
By far the best cakes I've ever eaten. Each had its own unique decoration and taste! Definitely dine in if you can. Take a look at all the cool details and how perfectly curated each piece is.,1
"Yum! I have only tried a handful of goodies from here and they were all very good! However, I think it's the ambiance of the bakery that really does it for me. It is so pretty and romantic in there. The perfect spot to take a date to for a sweet treat after 10pm ( they are open till 11pm ). They even have vegan offerings! I can't say much for service because both times I was there it was empty and everyone working seem pleasant.",1
"This place is just the cutest and I don't know how anyone wouldn't love it! I didn't get to stay when I went in yesterday, unfortunately, but I was able to snag a piece of their blueberry elderflower cake as I tagged along with a friend who was picking up a birthday cake for her boyfriend. I actually saved half of it for later which was a great idea, since the piece was rather large AND it was a lovely treat to look forward to. Amazing flavor and very moist cake. The icing is ...wowee. This would be a great place for some afternoon tea and dessert or a date night! Great music, lovely little patio, and awesome antique furnishings. I can't wait to try out some more delightful treats! The service was also very friendly.",1
"Cute little bake shop with cakes and brownies -- vegan options galore, if that's your thing! The girl at the counter was super nice and helpful. Decided to grab a brownie and it was not a mistake. Very fudgey and tasty. I have to say the biggest pro to this place is that it's open late. It's too bad they're not closer to the bars and restaurants on butler...",1
"To say I'm so happy that Butterwood is in the neighborhood is an understatement. This cute little bakery is such a gem- the decor is adorable and the cakes are exactly how cake should taste! I've probably been here more than ten times in the last month! The cake selection rotates with interesting and thoughtful flavors, and they are not only beautiful but oh, so delicious. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place!!!!",1
"Yummy ! Ate here after dinner, great coffee and yummy desserts with old world ambiance and a small outdoor garden outside. Love it!",1
Drive to Lawrenceville for a piece of cake? Yes Please! Visited this lovely boutique bakery tonight for dessert and we where over the moon. My husband had the rosemary cinnamon almond cake and I had the lavender infused cake. Several of the cakes were vegan and looked wonderful. Your piece of heaven is served on a China plate. The seating is either in its unique cafÃ© or outside on it's a wonderful patio. The prices are definitely worth it and did I say the cake was good? It is really really good. We are really looking forward to our next trip where we can try more delightful baked goods.,1
What a unique and special place in the city. I love the feminine romantic vibe with the high ceilings and pretty mixed furniture. A great relaxed place for a dessert date night or outing with a small group of girls. I've been here twice and both times had delicious treats. The giant blondie bar is so good. As well as the lemon blueberry tart. But all of their desserts in the case look so beautifully made. The staff is also friendly and helpful. I look forward to my next visit and next tasty treat.,1
"My new favorite bakery/sweet treat place. Everything I have tried here has been amazing. The espresso is good too! A little pricy, but that's expected for the location and quality of the pastries.",1
"Vegan dessert shop with high tea atmosphere. My friends shared some of their unique vegan pastries including a berry tart, a slice of cake, and a cupcake. I just had some tea. I had the apricot vanilla tea from Tazo. Service was friendly.",1
"Great, cute little place! Came with my wife and we each got a coffee, and split a raspberry rose love cake. Everything was excellent. The decor is also very well done, with lots of floral patterns that match the garnishes on the cakes. We will definitely come back!",1
"I accidentally ordered non-vegan cake for a celebration--the staff was very accommodating, offering me several vegan options and quickly making the substitution. We ended up with mini-cakes--the flavors were good and the cake was light and not overly sweet. Frosting was excellent. I look forward to returning to try other things!!",1
"Service is slow and it's expensive, but the cake makes up for it. I tried the chocolate peanut butter and loved it. The atmosphere and outdoor seating is also excellent. Can't wait to come back here and try more!",1
6hrs of Peloton tomorrow isn't going to be enough to undo the choices I made this evening!!!,1
Such a great bakery with really cool fun creations! The decor is beautiful inside and their cake case is gorgeous. You have to experience this place! They have vegan options and I think they grow what they use in their bakes. Only negative is that the pastries are quite pricey so it's definitely not an all the time treat for us.,1
"This is such a romantic and bohemian style place! I love the atmosphere in here and the women who work here/run the place are SO kind and lovely! So many delicious, fresh made and unique cakes and other sweet treats here! They also do have vegan and gluten free options! You can call and check what they have for the day before you go if you have dietary restrictions. I always make it a point to come when I'm in Pittsburgh!!",1
"My family and I went for the lush gothic decor - we stayed for the friendly service, rich coffee, and tasty food. The cafe is decorated with vases of dried flowers, dark paint, and comfortable reclaimed pews, wrought iron chairs, and eclectic upholstered pieces. The soundtrack was a fitting, pleasing Bowie- Velvet Underground-Joy Division mix. The staff was courteous and friendly. We ordered and paid at the counter then they served our order at the table. We enjoyed a French press of Columbian coffee, a decaf Americano, almond-milk hot chocolate, and cake - all winners. This is a welcoming place to linger over coffee and conversation. Check out the garden seating through the back door. Note: the restroom is in the basement - not universally accessible. Overall a treat - I look forward to my next visit.",1
"My first visit today after wanting to go. The place is very cute. The cake looked dense, but was so light and moist--I was pleasantly surprised. I had a lavender piece (small) and a slice of a blueberry cake (large) with hot chocolate. These three items cost close to $20...AND, I must say--the lavender piece, the small one, was enough, small yet filling. So, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I brought the blueberry piece home (after trying a small bite in the shop). Because of the prices (and no free coffee refills as someone in our group learned), this place is more of a special treat...or share one slice with a friend.",1
"They are perfection! I wanted to have some really special and interesting flavors of hand cakes for my cousin's bridal shower and Butterwood MORE than delivered! I was planning the event from another state so I had to do everything via email. They were so easy to work with! They had great flavor suggestions. I also asked if they could put just a few fresh flowers on a few of the cakes to be pretty. When it was finally the day to pick them up, pick up was a breeze. I didn't open the box until we got home and CHILLS!!! I literally got chills for how gorgeous the cakes were! Each one was a perfect little masterpiece. I ordered 5 flavors, 3 for the shower and 2 for the bachelorette part to follow. They were too gorgeous, so all 5 went to the shower! All of the ladies oohed and ahhed over them. But that wasn't even the best part: they tasted AMAZING!! I couldn't be happier with Butterwood!! They really added a special touch to a special day! I just wished I still lived in Pittsburgh so I could visit there all of the time and try all of their amazing treats and interesting flavors! Also, side note, though I just stopped in to pick up the cakes, the shop is also amazing! Great decor and atmosphere! I'd die to be on a date with my man or my mum here! PERFECTION all around!! THANK YOU BUTTERWOOD!!",1
"Great atmosphere, amazing cake. The vegan chocolate cake was outstanding, better than other vegan desserts in Pittsburgh by a lot. I highly recommend getting a seat on the couch, v comfy.",1
"This is a great little place on Butler to go for coffee and dessert . . . wonderful atmosphere and the sweets are very good. We usually walk over there after visiting Cure for dinner. I agree with Anne C., though, that sometimes they could be a little more bold on the flavors--subtle is good, but sometimes you want a little more 'pow' with the flavors. But overall, it is great and totally worth the visit. Hope to see y'all there.",1
"When I lived in Queens, there was an adorable bakery called Martha's that was open 6 am - 2 am, and it was perfect for the nights where you wanted to go out but not drink. Somehow I missed that Butterwood opened a few months ago, and I am sad it opened as I get ready to move out of Pittsburgh! Everyone needs a late night bakery in their life. The atmosphere is amazing. There are Victorian couches and chairs, and the whole place has a cozy but intimate vibe. They only have 6-8 desserts to choose from so don't expect to see walls of cakes here, but all of the options were unique. We decided to split a slice of the Lavender blackberry cake with vanilla buttercream, and while light in flavor, it was delicious. The cake was really moist, and the icing was not sickly sweet. At $6.49/slice, I thought it was super reasonable, considering the late hours and cute vibe. The other cakes looked awesome as well, and I would love to come back before I move. Coming in on a Wednesday night at 8:30, my roommate and I were the only people here. By the time we left, three more parties had come in. Parking was super easy in this part of Lawrenceville, which was also nice. They accept credit as well, so there is no reason not to test it out.",1
"I love trying interesting cakes here! I've been here plenty of times and maybe once or twice I've gotten a cake that wasn't what I expected. I love their unique flavors such as the lavender, rose, and chocolate beet cakes plus who doesn't love a good buttercream??? The blondies are tasty too. The interior has a very tea-time feel with upholstered seating and cafe tables. It reminds me of what my grandma would call a coffee klatsch. It's a cute place to enjoy dessert and a coffee with a few family members or friends, though slightly pricey.",1
"The Butterwood Bake Consortium is one of the most charming little bakeries I've encountered in quite some time. The decor is absolutely lovely. There's a very elegant vintage vibe here, with fluffy couches and lamps that cast a warm glow. I could definitely see myself coming here for a latte and some sweets and staying for quite awhile with a good book. The display of all the cakes, loaves, and tarts will make you drool! I had such a hard time deciding what to try, because everything looked incredible. After much deliberation, I chose the chocolate cake with cinnamon espresso cream and meringue. I have to say, the cake was very good. It was rich and moist, and the cinnamon added a nice unexpected touch. But unfortunately at $6 a slice, I just wasn't completely wowed after my first cake experience at Butterwood. After all the hype I had heard, I think my expectations were a little inflated; I was expecting the best slice of cake I've ever eaten, and didn't quite have that experience. I definitely want to come back and try more treats soon! All in all, I think Butterwood is a bit expensive for what it offers, but the atmosphere is wonderful. It's certainly worth a visit if you're in the area!",1
"I drove up the street chasing my sweet tooth and glad this is where it brought me. I mean holy baked goodness this place has arguably the best cake in Pittsburgh. Rich, sweet, layered, tasty and real. Sweet baby Jesus, just thinking about it makes me sad I left a bite on the plate. DONT YOU JUDGE ME. Just kidding judge away, after a hefty meal, this slice is a sharer. Taking on a slice on your own is only if you have the room after dinner or whatever. Running you around $7 for a slice, these cakes are clearly made the old-fashion way and with real ingredients- No preservatives, no bullshit. They have vegan options, which offends me because that's food discrimination, but I got over it shortly after my taste-buds simultaneously cried little tears of joy in my mouth. I tasted 3 different cakes but the one I devoured was the Pistachio, creme something something. I forgot the name because I blacked out from a flavor coma. WORTH EVERY PENNY. The place also has plenty of coffee options cold-press, espresso,lattes, mochas etc etc etc. (I had a cold press which was perfect bitter counter to the sweet cake.)The environment is cool but no way of browsing a menu for what you want to drink and if you ask the lady behind the counter she will be smart and snippy with you. A real negative Nancy. Good thing I couldn't remember her after I blacked out from how good the cake she gave me was.",1
"All of the baked goods are super tasty and amazing. The coffee also makes my spine tingle because it is so good. It's a great place to take pictures if you're a teen, or young adult, and you're into that vintage, edgy vibe. I would highly recommend rolling down to this cool, hipster bakery. I attached a picture of our lattes, please enjoy.",1
Delicious Lucious cake! Got a massive slice that I could barely finish. I also appreciated how they had late hours!! Very hard to find a bakery with late hours!,1
"Stopped for a quick coffee and dessert on a whim. The place is charming, we immediately got a hello when we entered the door. We had a selection of desserts even on a late afternoon. They were fresh and filling. The coffee was fabulous and the tea was satisfying. Enjoy!",1
"I walk by here (ironically to get to the gym!) and have been curious to check out the spot. It looks charming from the window. We were down that way for an errand with the pup, so hubs waited with pupster, while I went in. Hubs asked for something of his own or forewarned me that he would eat whatever I got. Noted. The cafe has an old world feel. Think a dark Viennese cafe. I made my way to the counter and saw so many beautiful cakes. Alas, cakes aren't practical for grab and go errand type. The brownies were huge and would fit the size criteria of a shared treat. Then I looked up and saw what I thought were whoopie pies (gobs for Western Pennsylvanians). I read closer and they're cookies with peanut buttercream filling. Done! We sat on the bench outside and shared the tasty treat. The buttercream was light and greatly paired well with the chocolate chip cookie. It was a bit messy to eat, but so good. Pupster enjoyed hanging on the bench, too!",1
"This place is great. The atmosphere is amazing. Beautiful artwork with lovely couches. The tea, coffee, and baked goods are out of this world. I cannot believe that their vegan stuff tastes as good as it does. They are also always so helpful when it comes to asking questions. I even got my wedding cake from here and it was magnificent.",1
"It's sometimes difficult to get tasty vegan desserts so I was looking forward to trying this place out! I love how unique and refined the flavors they offer are - of the things we ordered, my favorites were probably the matcha/rose cake or the blood orange loaf slice. The earl grey cake was quite dense however, and the raspberry buttercream was a bit too sweet and buttery tasting. Unfortunately, the lady that was working was not very friendly but I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt; perhaps she was having a rough day. Overall: The vegan goodies can lean on the dense or dry side but the flavor options are lovely and the desserts are beautiful!",1
If you are looking for a quaint coffee shop with excellent baked goods this is the spot. With different options everyday this is a place that won't get dull. Staff is very helpful and knowledgeable of the items sold.,1
"What a neat cozy and delicious place to grab some fantastic dessert with tea, coffee or hot cocoa! Visited on a Friday evening at 10 pm and enjoyed a slice of chocolate cake with pistachio creme filling accompanied by a lovely cup of Earl Gray tea. My husband opted for a blondie with chocolate chips accompanied by a cup of hot cocoa with creme on top. Everything was delicious and we look forward to returning to see what the next group of desserts is being offered.",1
"Our desserts for our wedding were made by Butterwood Bake Consortium, and weeks later our guests still cannot stop raving about how good everything was! We had a blood orange cake with vanilla mascarpone buttercream wedding cake, banana spice cake with mocha buttercream mini cakes, blondies, and brownies. Everything was AMAZING! I don't know how they do it, but their cakes are so dense and moist, and the brownies just melt in your mouth! Ally was amazing with answering our questions, and making sure everything was absolutely perfect. Butterwood is now my go-to bakery in the city. We'll be lifelong customers!",1
The pumpkin cake with maple buttercream frosting was delicious. Looking forward to having the gingerbread tomorrow.,1
"My absolute favorite bakery. Used them for my wedding and got so many compliments!! The cakes are delicious, I love that they are a bit thicker and not overly sweet. Not to mention they are beautiful! So many unique flavors to choose from too!",1
Reasonable prices for very unique tastes! We were looking for a new dessert place to check out and this was the cutest little shop with a variety of different desserts to choose from. Definitely recommend if you got a palette for flavors you don't normally see around!,1
"I first visited this place on the way home from doctoral classes because it seemed like a pretty great reward for having survived statistics. I have been here, oh, four or five times now and the only reason I'm not giving five stars is that, every once in a while, I get a cake that is a little too strange, even for me. However, most of them are fantastic. Sage with prickly pear? Awesome. Earl gray? Spectacular. And the hot chocolate is real CHOCOLATE. It will change your life, seriously. Also, the brownies are the richest you'll ever find. So, basically, come here. Do it now. It is open late. Have a complex cake like Vegan lavender honey cream with edible flowers. You will not regret it. This is real cake, not a mix. Bask in it and be happy!",1
"This is the best cake I have ever had. The cake is so moist and the icing so light it melts in your mouth. I always get the mini cakes because they are just perfect. I haven't found anything that compares in Pittsburgh, but I will keep you posted.",1
"Came here on a late Thursday afternoon and the place was completely empty. The decor is great. Was not sure what to expect about the cake options and was pleasantly surprised. They had a variety of unique cake flavors and vegan options. I ended up deciding on a lavender olive oil cake with pistachio buttercream and a latte. They do not have a coffee menu also fyi. My friends ordered and then we waited. The interior decor is beautiful so really didn't mind waiting for the coffee and cake. There was only one lady working so we understood it would take some time. Was so happy to see latte art on all three of our drinks. I had a latte and my friends had cappuccinos. I was so excited that they served the cake on cute china. The lavender olive oil cake was hands down the best cake I have ever had. The olive oil made the cake so dense and rich and the lavender was the perfect complement. It was not too overbearing. The pistachio buttercream was also perfect and not too sweet or rich. Surprisingly, after eating the slice of cake I was so full. Was hesitant, because for a piece of cake and latte it was $10.70, but I will definitley come back and try other cake flavors!",1
Very cute bakery! They have so many interesting flavors which change daily! I ordered the gingerbread cake with maple espresso cream - extremely decadent! (Definitely recommend splitting between two people - I'm still (hours later) in a food coma after eating it all) The store itself is quite quiet and not a bad study spot either! Excited to go back and to try something else !,1
"In the wise words of Rhianna - cake cake cake cake cake cake! (And delicious coffee too!) This place is my dream. Their decor is fabulous, very Parisian Victorian with some modern etsy kitsch. Super comfortable. The staff is wonderfully friendly and welcoming...but really it's the CAKE! I can't believe I'm lucky enough to live in a neighborhood with this bakery! The desserts I've tried so far have been luxurious and decadent. Olive oil fig cake with pistachio buttercream icing...butterscotch pudding...chocolate peanut butter cake...like nothing I've ever tasted. I will happily continue to indulge in my new favorite Larryville spot.",1
"Came here with my mom after dinner as the desserts at the restaurant did not appeal to us. There were about 6 different specialty cakes on display, and we went with lavender with strawberry buttercream (based on other reviews, I believe the flavors regulary change). We were given a generous slice and they also gave me a candle since it was her birthday. Cute coffeeshop/bakery with Victorian plating, decor and furniture. Would be a cozy place to spend an afternoon or have a date.",1
"I ordered the 9 inch lemon almond cake with buttercream and lemon curd icing for my son's 42nd. birthday. The cake was probably the best cake that I have had in years maybe in my life. Also it was beautifully decorated with fresh leaves and tulips. There were six of us and we all had a generous slice and extra for them to take home. I love icing and it was to die for, thick and delicious. In the past I have also had the lavender cake (a slice) and it also stayed in my memory as incredibly good. BTW the bakery inside is decorated like a jewel box with gorgeous lighting and wallpaper.",1
"I'm usually not a (cup)cake person, but Butterwood has changed my mind! The chocolate cupcake with raspberry was moist and delicious. The buttercream frosting was stiffer than I was expecting, but worked perfectly. We also got a brownie each, which were both large and super chocolatey. The dÃ©cor was unique and it had a great feel. I will absolutely be coming here again, plus they're open late!",1
"Awesome KLVN coffee and scrumptious desserts. Serious coffee, no flavors but you can get your latte sweet if desired. French victorian decor meets shabby chic. My new favorite coffee shop.",1
"A very delicious bakery, but I do think it's suited best for people with a certain taste. I like my cakes and icing very sweet and soft, and I find the icing style here to be much more on the butter-y and thick side, less on the sweet side. They have classic flavors and more experimental flavors, but nothing too out of the box and I think everything works really well. The indoor space is beautiful (almost Victorian decorated?) and they have a small back patio you can sit at.",1
Found this place online after eating at SMOKE. So happy we decided to stop in. It was busy but not crazy. Easy to order and sit to wait for our espresso and cake. Ordered the Tumeric cake and some butterscotch pudding. Both excellent. Chill vibe. Great place to come for dessert or just a coffee. Staff friendly.,1
I stopped in early on a Wednesday night looking for a nice place for my mom and I to enjoy dessert and chat. The ambiance is remarkable. I ended up having the vegan lavender cake and was blown away! I usually cringe when thinking about vegan desserts but this was so light and elegant. My mom had the poppyseed cake and really enjoyed it. The lady working was extremely friendly and hospitable.,1
"Very cute store with a wide variety of treats. Gluten free and vegan selections are very nice options to have and not always easy to come by. Cappuccino was one of the best I've had in Pittsburg. The chocolate cake was just ok unfortunately. The frosting was a bit artificial for me, and dropped an otherwise 5/5 place to just a 4. But if your looking for a cute place to try some AMAZING coffee this is a MUST.",1
"I live in the neighborhood and finally stopped in. It was worth it. They have items for everyone, vegan included. Though, I will say, 9/10 of the combination choices are ""unique"" -- which personally I love, but if you're looking for the plain Jane typical options, maybe go elsewhere. When we went I tried a pound cake with pistachio cream with fresh strawberries. I didn't really get too much pistachio, but it was decadent and very good. The same for the chocolate brownie. Amazing! The place itself has interesting decor and the originality alone is worth the trip if you're nearby!",1
Everything we have had here is amazing. The atmosphere is great to have a date night or hang out with some friends. I am also pleasantly surprised by the creative options we find each time we go.,1
Had a blueberry basil with whiskey cream cake and brown butter blonde. Delicious and unique flavors in a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. We'll be back!,1
"Yuuuum!! This place is incredible. I went with the chocolate cake w/raspberry buttercream icing (it was vegan). Probably one of the best vegan desserts I've ever had. It was so tasty and rich w flavor, which is not the case in most vegan desserts. The service was great, and our waitress was very helpful. I heard about this place from social media so I decided to try it after dinner. It was the perfect end to the night! It also doesn't hurt that it's so freaking cute inside! Love it. I will be back.",1
"I stopped by with two friends a couple of weeks ago on a Sat. evening. Given that we were looking to get together later in the evening for hot beverages or dessert, Butterwood fit the bill, so we headed over to L-ville to check it out. Because their specialty is clearly cake and there weren't many other desserts in the case, we each ordered a slice of cake ($6 + tax each). Going against my usual adventurous streak when it comes to edibles, I decided to play it safe and stick with the chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream icing. The cake was velvety in texture, but not quite as most as I was hoping, and it was rather stiff on the iced side. As for the icing, it was definitely the best part of the cake--it was decadently creamy and rich, as buttercream should be. My friends ordered the chocolate pistachio cake and the vanilla poppy seed cake, and I tried bites of both. The cake component of the chocolate pistachio seemed identical to my chocolate cake, but the icing was saltier than mine with a rather muted pistachio taste. The vanilla poppy seed was the most interesting of the bunch, consisting of yellow cake and tangy vanilla icing sprinkled generously with poppy seeds. As others have mentioned, the slices were rather large, such that neither of my friends entirely finished theirs (as usual, I unabashedly housed my entire slice, however). If you visit and don't see a cake that you'd enjoy, I'd recommend waiting a bit and checking back, given that the cakes seem to rotate. By the time that we left, all of the cakes that'd been available when we ordered had been replaced by different types of cakes (hello, Meyer lemon cake!). The atmosphere is quaint, making it an ideal setting in which to relax and catch up over dessert and/or hot beverages. If you're a night owl and/or a fan of dessert, I definitely recommend checking it out--your inner Martha Stewart will definitely be pleased!",1
"This is the third time I come here and I love it. Tonight we got a lemon and pistachio cake! The cake is moist, the lemon flavor is very and I would say that the frosting adds anything to it: it is already delicious. The selection of cakes is always changing, so hurry up and go try it!",1
"I loved this impromptu stop over the weekend. It's a super cute, tiny space with comfortable seating options and friendly service. I got tea and split a snickerdoodle blondie with a friend that was unique and delicious. We sat and talked and although we had planned to walk around a bit after we stayed long enough that we had to head straight out. It's a perfect place to sit for a spell and chat with friends or read a book and all their sweet treats looked amazing. There was also a flier on the counter for an evening knitting group that apparently meets there. Highly recommend and I am definitely getting my next birthday cake from them!",1
"Fantastic little bakery/cafe in Lawrenceville. The cakes are delicious and dense, and the buttercream frosting is to die for. The chai latte was the perfect temperature and wasn't too sweet. Go with a few friends so you can sample all the treats!",1
"Updating my review to include a custom cake order my office had placed for a co-worker's birthday. We placed an order for the cake on Tuesday and it was ready Friday morning. We ordered a vegan cake, chocolate base with pistachio buttercream. It was easily one of the best cakes I've ever had. We didn't ask for any decoration but it still came beautifully presented. Absolutely will be ordering cakes from here in the future!",1
"We found the Butterwood on Yelp while searching for some desert to cap off dinner and a show at The Cabaret. Tucked away at the North end of Butler Street in Lawrenceville, this little place is a gem. The mashup of Victorian influence and bare brick walls adorned with interesting art just works. The case is filled with delicious deserts and there is an array of beverages to sip on. Give this comfortable and cozy desert cafe a try the next time you find yourself in L-ville. You'll be glad you did.",1
"One of the coolest bakeries in Pittsburgh! I've gone a couple times and each has been extremely enjoyable. The inside is so welcoming and has a wonderful warm atmosphere. The baked goods are always different, and there are tons of vegan options! I got a the chocolate cake with almond butter cream icing and my girlfriend got the lavender bunt cake. Both were fantastic and they warmed our desserts up before serving them. The cake was very moist and the icing was light and not too sweet. I'm not one to always get chocolate cake as a dessert but I couldn't resist with this one. The lavender cake was so good. There was a hint of lemon that paired so perfectly with the cake. The flavors were all light and nothing clashed. The hot chocolate is an experience in itself. It's a sipping chocolate that they make in house. It's very unique and if you like rich chocolate flavors you'll love this! It's not really sweet, it's more on the bitter side but it's a perfect match with the sweet cakes. Heads up: there is pretty limited seating.",1
"Whoo haaaa, finally stopped by this oddly named bakery in the far end of Lawrenceville area. They have lovely cupcakes, tea cakes, vegan and non. The tea was pretty good as well. I think the baked goods are yummy and of a good quality, however the prices are severely extravagant. Our bill came to 25 dollars and it was just for one blondie, one slice of rose tea cake and two teas. If you want to buy an actual cake from them it is literally 400 dollars, WTF? What has happened to this world that people can charge this much for food?",1
"The space is absolutely fantastic, dark and gothic but also homey comfortable, I love it! We tried a few different cakes and pastries and all of them were exceptional, the focus on herbs was pleasant and played really well. I had a herbal tea and my friends had lattes, all were good. I'm definitely adding it to my lawrenceville agenda when I'm in the area!",1
"This place is SO darling! So unique. Such a fun addition to Lawrenceville. A ""dessert cafÃ©"", I've only ever popped in and gotten stuff to go, but plan a visit to enjoy their fabulous desserts, coffee, and tea inside. The dÃ©cor is so fun, they have an array of eclectic chairs, velour couches, and tables for dining, drinking and relaxing, and a tiny little outside area with a few tables as well. Closed Monday & Tuesday, the rest of the weekdays they're open noon until 11 PM - open late, love it! Perfect for post-dinner dessert and tea. Weekend hours they open at 10 AM and close a little earlier. If you're in or around Lawrenceville, definitely add a visit here to the top of your list. Their desserts are truly SO decadent and delicious. They use only organic Daisy flour, Wholesome Sweeteners sugar, and local organic eggs. Their display case is always full of the most gorgeous cookies, cakes, cupcakes, bars, etc., always with vegan and non-vegan options, and sometimes gluten free as well. I mean....it can't get better than this! And you can truly tell they use quality ingredients because the look, taste and feel is topnotch. They do custom cake ordering as well. Two recent standout desserts include the vegan lavender cake with buttercream icing, and the vegan chocolate cupcake with peanut butter icing...wow. My boyfriend's go-to is the Blondie bar...so good. Treat yourself next time you're in the neighborhood, you will not regret it!",1
"I have not actually been to this location, but had one of their amazing cakes! For my baby shower, my friend ordered a vegan carrot cake with the vegan buttercream icing. It was honestly one of the best baked vegan treats I have ever had! The icing was so decadent and the perfect balance of not being too sweet. The cake was soft, moist and so fresh! The cake was decorated with real, fresh and beautiful flowers. I look forward to making a trip to the storefront to try even more of their amazingly vegan treats!",1
Ohhhemmmmgeeeee! I'm seriously so in love with this place. The cake was so freakin good. Somehow she managed to serve it where the bread was slightly warm but the icing was still cold. Chefs kiss man. You can tell it was made with quality ingredients & a lot of thought was put into the flavors. The ambiance of this place is amazing. HIGHLY recommend. We visited Pittsburg for the first time this weekend & this was on my list of places to go- it surpassed all expectations.,1
I was visiting my hometown for my Dad's 70th birthday. This bakery was recommended to me because they have vegan options. The cake was fabulous! Vanilla with coconut buttercream. So yummy! Everyone loved it. Highly recommended.,1
Lovely cakes and the iced chai was so good! Cute interiors too - and I LOVE that they're open so late.,1
"As I'm sure you've read from other reviews that this place is pricey, the ever changing selection of sweet, decadent baked goods make up for it. The toddler got a vegan noir chocolate cake, which he devoured, and the MIL and I got a buttercream blood orange cake, which we ate in an unladylike fashion by scarfing down. No shame because the cake was gooood!",1
Great little bakery/coffee shop in upper Lawrenceville. The desserts are beyond beautiful and taste amazing! The service and the wifi are a bit slow but otherwise well worth a visit!,1
"After running by this place numerous times and wondering what a ""bake consortium"" was, we finally walked in and discovered a beautiful coffee and bake shop. The space is decorated like a traditional old-fashioned tea parlor with crystal cake stands, wrought iron seating and tables, and dramatic wallpaper. What my husband referred to as a""hipster interpretation of 1920s jazz music"" played in the background. An impressive array of treats are on display, including vegan options (no gluten-free on this day, sadly). The barista was excellent and took great care with my americano and my husband's pour over, and they tasted lovely because of it. A quick trip this is not- plan on stopping by in their cozy space for a chat and a dessert. I do suggest better signage, since we weren't sure if we could go in at first! But do go, and enjoy a lovely afternoon brew and treat.",1
"Open late! A pleasant surprise from what otherwise appeared to be a dead city during the week. Came with my mom looking for good dessert with vegan options, and this place more than satisfied. We shared a slice of their vegan chocolate strawberry cake, and an oatmeal cookie sandwich type thing with coffee filling. Both were fantastic, and moist. I could be biased, but neither appeared to lose any flavor or produce any weird aftertaste as a result of being vegan. Only complaint would be that they were just a bit too sweet. The frosting was very, very sugary. We also had tea along with the dessert, which was a good compliment to the food and the cold weather outside. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to hang out later at night in this city, or looking for good dessert in general.",1
"To know me is to know that my favorite food is cake. That being said, my expectations are high. The best of the best in my opinion is...wait for it...Giant Eagle. Yep. I love the sugary sweet icing and the texture of their cakes. BUT, Butterwood is giving GE a run for their batter. I stopped in on Saturday with some family to complement our delicious and decadent dinner from Dive. Among our choices were a Cranberry [short] cake (literally - it was short), cinnamon/chocolate cake; vanilla/sunflower seed and chocolate/sweet potato. I split the sunflower seed and sweet potato options and DANG, these are GOOD cakes! They're so dense and flavorful I actually couldn't finish - which is VERY unlike me. Take a pic, because now that a bakery is open down the street from me until ELEVEN PM, I'll be twice my size in no time. At $6+ a pop, I might also be broke, but I'll also be happy - so bring on the Butterwood P.S. I got our cakes to go, but look forward to eating in next time. The dÃ©cor is straight out of a Victorian cakery! Love it!",1
"The interior styling and decor of this cafe is incredible with usage of antiques and vintage items to create a cozy, artsy aesthetic. The Butterwood offers a variety of succulent gourmet pastries and cakes with surprising flavors to delight every taste bud. In addition, many coffees and teas are available to accompany your sweet treat. Service is always excellent and the baristas are extremely helpful answering any and all questions. If you want to stop somewhere for a great (and unique) baked good and hot beverage in an interesting setting, you must stop here!",1
"Great hot chocolate, I would go there just for that. The cake choices are interesting and I give them props for having a cool atmosphere, great customer service, and vegan options but unfortunately, I never liked any of the cakes. The cakes are gritty and the frosting is oily tasting. Get the hot chocolate!",1
"Super fun cute place to have something sweet and a coffee or tea. I wouldn't go here if you're in a rush, only 1 employee. The homemade cakes and icings are delicious AND beautiful! Fun place to go alone or with a friend to catch up!",1
"The soft-serve is way too sweet and has a strange Splenda-like aftertaste. The flavors tasted very artificial, and I ended up with a stomach ache when I got home... I really don't recommend this place, your simple Baskin Robbins is much better.",0
"Went here for the 1st time tonight. I ordered a turtle tornado. It was excellent. TONS of pecans and lots of flavor. I guess I could be picky and say that it melted incredibly fast. Too bad my wife and son didn't have the same experience. My son ordered a plain chocolate cone. My wife ordered a vanilla cone w/ a chocolate dip. I tasted both, after they said theirs didn't taste very good. I totally agreed. Both were very watery in flavor. My sons had a bit of an icy consistency. Instead of ice cream or custard - they resembled ice milk. Not going back. Jarling's Custard Cup is way, way better.",0
"Ice cream is good but the service could be improved. I rarely get what I actually order. A peanut butter cup tornado with chocolate ice cream isn't that hard to understand or make. They just lack attention to detail. First they made me a m&m tornado with chocolate ice cream and when I told them it was supposed to be peanut butter cup, I got a peanut butter cup with vanilla ice cream. This didn't happen just once either. My order is wrong more times than it is right! I'll just start telling them to surprise me since I always am when I go here.",0
This was the longest wait I've had for an ice cream cone. Also the most I've paid for one. Almost 10$ for an ice cream cone. Nothing to write home about. This was a miss for me,0
"I used to looove this place (hence my previous 5 star review), but the last few times it's been so beyond lacking in service. I don't know if it's what I've been ordering or what, but it takes forever! And I don't think a shake at an ice cream place is crazy. People will get served way before and I've had to ask if my stuff is going to come out. When you ask it's like a lightbulb comes on and they realize they forgot your items. I asked for two scoops of ice cream the first time and that took 25 minutes to get (after asking about it). This most recent time was a mint chocolate chip ""bowl"" (which came out timely but melted all over my jeans and car by the end of it because they couldn't give me a lid) and a strawberry shortcake shake (which took crazy long to produce). I love this place, but I have no idea what is happening.",0
Absolutely awful experience!! It was hair in my ice cream and the manager was super rude about it and said they don't give refunds!,0
"Let me say, I usually love this place. My negative review is that I've driven to their location and ordered through app and my favorite item is on the website and online order form and it's not something they claim to carry except seasonally. If you don't want to carry Pineapple Express year round, please remove it from your Chandler location menu.",0
"both times I've been, their boba is cooking and won't be done for about 30mins. What is the point in offering boba tea when your boba isn't ready ever. Maybe start making the boba before you open? Giving up on this place.",0
"Watch out people. First they don't honor your Yelp freebies AND they have an attitude AND the vegan coconut ice cream tastes like sugar water. No flavor at all. AND it's EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE. The young lady taking my order, must have been in a place where she couldn't hear what I ordered. I looked at the menu board and thought I ordered a cup with one scoop of ice cream and another cup with two scoops of ice cream. I also had a free topping. She distinctly told me that chocolate chips could not be ""swirled ""in. I had no idea what she was talking about. I said OK put the chocolate chips on the side; that's OK for me. She shook her head yes. I ordered two scoops of ice cream for my other half. And we were supposed to get another free topping with our Yelp Check-in. Then she rang up my bill at $15.86. I thought well four dollars for one scoop and six dollars for two scoops... How does that equal $15.86? I showed the cashier the bill and she re-rang it up as $11.86. Another little girl from behind the counter came up, looked at my receipt and just said: ""Nooooooooooo...."" while shaking her head. I was still confused but I went ahead and went with it. I found out later (from watching and listening to other customers ordering) what they do is they take the topping and mix it in through some machine and charge a whole lot more money for that. But how was I supposed to know that was my first time there. My advice is ask questions before ordering. Especially if it's your first time; because nothing was explained to us and it was our first time. I personally will never come back here. To me a customer and their service to a customer should come first. I believe we were treated unfairly and to eat ice cream in such an environment where I am treated this way does not feel respectful or comforting which is the whole idea of going for ice cream to me",0
The atmosphere was nice and I was excited to try a new place. My ice cream was good but the other one we ordered was not and I ordered a Thai tea with boba(my favorite drink) ans had to throw it away. It was not good at all. Tasted watered down was tart nothing like my normal place. I'll stick to my normal place down the street. It looks so good in the pictures and on reviews and did not live up to the hype at all,0
"All of the positive things I have to say about this place have to do with the branding and the service - the guy working was super nice and patient, waiting for us to make up our minds for what probably felt to him like forever. We were having so much trouble because the drink menu looked SO tempting. Eventually, we ordered: a cocoa puffs chocolate brownie ice cream monstrosity for him; a coconut milk/matcha drink for me, 20% sugar (yes, they allow you to choose your sugar percentage down to the percentage point. Awesome). So something really awful must have happened for me to give one star at this point, right? Yeah. The drink happened. The drink was just... terrible. Instead of using actual coconut milk, they used what tasted like an avalanche of artificial coconut flavor. Maybe there was actual coconut milk under there, but I honestly couldn't tell. It tasted like a Mounds bar. The matcha, layered on top, was visible, you know, visually, but taste-wise it may as well have been green water. Then, to top it off, the boba were like Aunt Jemima's ""maple"" corn syrup sweetness bombs. The combination was so repugnant that I failed to finish my drink even though it was 110 outside, I had just finished rock climbing, and I was parched. It just made me feel nauseous to sip it. We ended up going somewhere else to get cold drinks. The guy working did let me know that he would be willing to adjust my drink if I didn't like it - but there are no 'adjustments' that would have saved this drink beyond throwing it away and starting over.",0
This place took way to long to prep my order for my Postmates order. 15-20 waiting for prepping the order and when my Postmates delivery person arrived - it still was not ready. 3 Thai Teas - 1 with Boba - how long does that take to prepare?,0
"Don't send your child in alone. The girl behind the counter told our grandson the machine was broken so his kid cup was filled only one-third of the way (about 5 tablespoons) and watery, although he still paid full price and tipped. When he returned to the car he was obviously disappointed so I went in to ask about it. The shift manager told me that's how they come now and then added, ""Have a nice day."" I guess rudeness and minion size portions is how they roll! As for us, we walked over to Culliver's where my grandson got a real size cup of ice cream with great customer service!",0
"Definitely not good for kids. Very offensive music playing. I don't think Yelp would let me repeat the lyrics in a review so how is it okay to assault our ears with that shit. It belongs in the club, or at home. I wouldn't take my family here again. My daughter didn't even like her icecream. It was mushy and dripping and she loves almost all icecream. Avoid!",0
"Visiting from out of town, read the reviews so decided to try it out since it closed a little late. Got there just right before they closed, a little expensive for 3 drinks and ice cream in a cup. Drinks weren't all that great, even the ice cream didn't taste good. Waste of my money, I would say bcz didn't even drink half of my drink before I decided to toss it in the trash!",0
"This girl named ""Stephanie"" took my order and was so rude and she had the worst attitude, I ordered one ice cream and it took over 20 minutes and I could see her on her phone in the back while I was waiting. The worst experience ever and the worst worker I've met anywhere!",0
"Worst place I ever visited. If you order via online as exactly they instructed at the door, you obviously have to wait for +20 mins to get your order. And when you make any sensible suggestions, the workers will be furiously mad and rude to you.",0
"If you want to pay $7 for a scoop of crunchy vanilla ice cream, then this place might be for you. I was utterly baffled by the concept of this place, but curiosity got the better of me. In hindsight, the $4.50 ""bowl of cereal with milk"" should have been a major red flag. While the first layer of caramel and brownies that topped my creation were admittedly rather tasty, the crunchy mess below was immensely unsatisfying. I'm pretty confused by other reviews pointing out ample parking and ""competitive pricing,"" which were not my experience at all.",0
"I probably would have given a 3 star, but my 2 visits left a bitter aftertaste. On my first visit it was really packed. So I couldn't ask about pricing or how ordering worked. My sister and I thought the ice cream was good, but really heavy and sweet. The service was fast, but not really friendly since it felt like they were in training mode and I felt really rushed. The cashier making my order also forgot I ordered a second ice cream. So I had to remind her. On top of that, I kept getting weird looks that I couldn't decipher... maybe annoyed. Plus, she also forgot my extra topping, which is 50 cents extra. I had to remind her yet again. It was a really meager amount too. She also got chocolate drizzle all over the sides of the cup, but she kind of quickly wiped it down when she was instructed to. But I still got chocolate all over my hands. The ice cream was also really expensive for how small the portion size was. I paid about $16 for the two ice creams and the extra topping on both. So it ended up being around $6ish for each. I had no idea what the pricing would be until after I ordered because the price wasn't listed for the signature items on their wall menu. The cashier also didn't give me a receipt until I asked, so I had no idea what I paid since I missed what the total was due to the choatic environment. On a side note, when paying, you swipe for debit and insert chip for credit. The cashier didn't explain this. So my card wouldn't go through when I chose debit and inserted my card.. She didn't bother explaining why my card wouldn't go through. So I just ended up guessing and tried swiping. My card finally went through. They really need to take the time to communicate no matter how busy it is. It left a bad impression. I decided to give it another try the next day since I was in the area. I didn't know what time they opened, so I ended up coming too early and waited close to 30 minutes. When I entered, I heard the cashier kind of groan or make some sound similiar to a groan. I felt unwelcomed, but I ignored it since I waited 30 minutes since my sister really wanted a drink. I ended up getting two drinks: the Matcha Coffee and the Strawberry Matcha Latte. The cashier for this second visit also did not tell me about the payment process. She chose credit for me, and I inserted my card since I remembered the other day that I chose debit and needed to swipe. This was annoying because if I had a card without a chip, and I tried swiping after she chose credit for me my card wouldn't have gone through. Anyway, the coffee drink for the price definitely wasn't worth it. They add plain cane sugar for the coffee. For the price, I was hoping for honey or a higher quality sweetener. But the strawberry latte was good. It just needed more strawberry syrup. Although how they make the drinks seem inconsistent. I was watching the drink making process, and the cashier was using two different brands of almond milk because it must have ran out. Anyway, my sister noticed that her almond milk was low quality and tasted bad before she mixed her latte. I didn't even tell her that it was low quality milk, until after she told me her observation. They used Great Value almond milk in her drink, while they used Simple Truth in mine. For the price, they should use a good brand of milk substitute. The cheap stuff tends to taste bad. She liked the matcha though. She thought it might have been a high quality matcha. I have to agree on that. I ended up googling them since I was curious about the reviews because my overall experience was pretty bad. When browsing the pictures, I noticed that our ice cream was definitely much smaller and it was more of a heavy concrete texture compared to the light swirls in the pictures. I took the ice creams togo. So I guess they cut the size down to get the lid on. They should have told me I would get more than 50% less ice cream if I got a lid. They need to get bigger lids or something. Although what angered me was that in the pictures, the Cookies and Cream ice cream had Cocoa Puffs and Cookie Crisps. However, my ice cream definitely did not have any of those toppings. When I ate it the day before, I just assumed they blended it into my ice cream. Lastly, the Minion's Treat was either missing the almonds or it was such a skimpy amount that I couldn't see it or taste it. The ice creams in the pictures had a decent amount of toppings for the exact ice creams we got. I don't know why we barely had any toppings and some of our toppings were missing. We are lactose intolerant. This was supposed to be a rare treat worth the stomach pains and other problems. The only nice thing about the experience was that the owner/manager/trainer or whatever her position is seemed nice. She told the girl making my order to wipe the chocolate drizzle off the sides of my cup because she was about to hand it to me without wiping it. She also got me a togo menu when I asked for one.",0
I was excited to try this new ice cream shop since it's walking distance from my house. They mix cereals into their ice cream. I wasn't too interested in trying that but did have cookies and cream mixed in with a little chocolate syrup as a topping. The ice cream is sickening sweet - I couldn't finish it. Worst ice cream I've ever eaten. They are expensive also. They weren't busy on a Friday night - now I know why.,0
I found your place yesterday and got an ice cream swirl. Then I insisted on coming back the next day with my adult daughter and boyfriend. I bought another ice cream swirl. Daughter and boyfriend ordered a milkshake and a ice cream swirl in a cup. Both of my cones were pure perfection. My daughter enjoyed the flavor is her milkshake but thought it was thin. Her boyfriend got a swirl that looked like it was in a child's cup. I saw other customer receive their orders and get larger portions and large containers. I didn't say anything until we left when he said he enjoyed his ice cream but it was too small of a serving for $6+. I was alarmed to hear that he had not ordered your one scoop serving. Very disappointing! Update: they are allowing the bf to get another serving on their dime. Thank you for making it right.,0
"Great customer service, I ordered a Oreo flavor cone today. Everything seems alright until I finished half way and found a tissue inside my ice cream, I think I have swallowed a few pieces..I thought it was oatmeal at first........",0
"I've been here a few times and the tea is pretty good. We are currently here and it has been over 30 minutes and we are still waiting for our tea. There is only one person working and he continues to take orders even though he was backed up. Probably won't come here again. On a personal note, we didn't care for the music either.",0
Trying to call them for allergy question and it goes straight to an automatic system. Not driving 30 min to find out if they have plant base option or not,0
We came for their famous lobster tail pastry. They were $8 plus each. It was very crunchy not flakey. For my mom it was hard for her to bite into it because it was so crisp hard. It was okay. Probably will not buy it again. The rainbow slice cake was decent.,0
"We were very excited to try The Cake Boss bakery, but it was disappointing. The kids had ordered a cake online and was delivered to our home a while back and I thought for the price point it was just ok, my opinion. The kids love the flavor of the rainbow cake option over taste. The bakery is very popular with great reviews so I'm going to assume that the bakery puts out fresh cakes and not refrigerated ones. Due to his popularity, they a very busy bakery but please focus on your shipments of cakes and vending machines supplies because I have now tried both and have been very disappointed for the amount of money spent quantity over quality.",0
"I was so excited to go here, but that excitement soon turned to disappointment. We had never been to a Carlo's Bakery in person, and we are fans of Buddy, of course, so we had to go while in Vegas. We waited in a decently long line, which gave us time to look at all the things that were wrong with this place. The display cases were filthy and messy. Frosting, sprinkles and crumbs were everywhere. There were even some cupcakes that had fallen upside down that just laid there in the case looking oh so sad. Several of the trays were empty, one of those being cannolis. One of the main reasons we wanted to go to Carlo's was was to try one of their famous cannolis. Sadly, that didn't happen. Mind you this was in the middle of the day. It wasn't like we were there 10 minutes til close. On top of that the food that was in the case was not properly labeled. Many things had no labels at all. This can be dangerous for folks with food allergies and annoying to other people trying to communicate what they want to the workers. We ended up getting a lobster tail and a napoleon type thing (a layered cake. no sign, so who knows what it was!). The lobster tails tasted stale and like it had sat in a fridge for a week. The cake thing was just not good. The flavor was not good. I took one bite of each and wished I had spent that $20 on a slot machine instead of desserts that wal-mart can do better than. I really hope Buddy and his family get a handle on things and get their locations back in shape, because I don't think this is the quality they had in mind for their customers.",0
"The staff are quick and efficient. The shop is cute. The fondant skills for the cake are amazing. HOWEVER, everything may look delicious, but it won't taste it. We waited in line for about 25 minutes and was truly disappointed. We got: One yellow cupcake with buttercream - cake was dry and frosting was flavorless. One cream puff - The cream inside was once again flavorless and tasted like overcooked eggs. The pastry part was not flakey at all. One cup of strawberry shortcake - Besides the strawberry, I toss the cup away. The cake was once again dry and the whipped cream was flat. A sprinkle cookie - It was okay. Nothing worth the half hour wait. We tossed most of the items away, since it so bland. If you're going to eat something bad for your health, every bite better be worth it! This was not worth it. It's also overpriced and overcrowded, yet sadly the pastries are underachieved.",0
"While walking by the Strip, we've stopped at the Venetian for lunch and happened to pass by Carlo's Bakery. I used to walked Cake Boss on TLC, so just for nostalgia's sake, I decided to get some treats here. Good: I really wanted to say it lives up to the hype, but it doesn't. If you go during the day, the line up is pretty long, so go in the evening and you'll wait less. The service was good and the staff was courteous. Location is pretty clean too. Bad: I've gotten 2 cannoli, one dipped in chocolate and one regular. The chocolate one had a dry and waxy taste, which wasn't awful but wasn't pleasant neither. It just didn't taste fresh. I've had better cannolis from Italian pastry shops back in Montreal. At $4 a piece, it's still pretty hefty for a mediocre pastry. Bottom line: me thinks not. I don't think I would go back and wait in line again. The other food didn't look tempting neither, so I don't think I'd be interested in trying anything else.",0
"I was not impressed but was shocked by the prices. RIDICULOUS! I guess they assume you have extra money to throw around since you're in LV. Anyhow, loved the lobster tails besides the excessive amount of filling. The cannolis where not great. The lb of cookies was 16.95. I think. Cupcakes 3.50 ea. I didnt not expect to pay so much for pastries. To top it off we stood in a LONG ASS line to order and when i was called to pay and pick up i was told my order of cannolis was taken. Wtf! How does that happen? Its called shitty customer service and a waste of time. I saw a pregnant lady leave upset. I would be too, if i was pregnant with a craving! Seriously, avoid this place unless you wany to give it a try. You were warned. I will try to post up picture of receipt.",0
I had several items (5 items) and they were only so so. Most of the items were thrown away 1/2 finished by the people I was with. Nothing we ordered was great... I don't think I will be back. I had several cupcakes (peanut butter). Much better food to be found in Vegas.,0
"I really wanted this experience to be the best one I had ever experienced because of the hype and it wasn't. The lobster tails were old, dry and flavorless. the Cannoli's were missing flavor as well, I loved the filling but for the price it just wasn't worth it. I can honestly say that I won't be going back to Carlo's.",0
I bought two cupcakes here and I was terribly disappointed. The cake was dry and rather lacking in flavor. I am afraid that a Target cupcake was fresher. I would not buy a cupcake here again.,0
"Not worth the wait. Was pretty disappointed to have stood in line for 1 cannoli and 1 lobster tail, only to have spent $10 on not-that-great-tasting treats. Not sure if it was just my pallet but the lobster tail was very bland. The cannoli was over creamed. Probably enjoyed the first bite of each and was immediately sick of it afterwards. If you've never had anything from this bakery, definitely try it. They have a great way of branding the name. Not to mention Buddy's restaurant is directly across the hall. Might try that place sometime. Other than that, I would take a hard pass on this bakery next time.",0
"We were so excited to eat desserts from ""Cake Boss!"" Being in Vegas, we thought we had our chance. We ordered a wide variety-strawberry shortcake, carrot cake, confetti cake, and Italian cheesecake. The only thing that was delicious was the strawberry shortcake. Everything else was dry and the taste ratios were off. Frosting was way too sweet and and the cake tasted old. Such a let down. Sadly, I'm no longer excited to visit the original store out East due to our experience here. 4 pieces of cake and 2 bottled waters were nearly $50! We didn't even finish the cakes and there were 6 of us. Sorry Buddy, you lost my repeat business.",0
"My Wife and Kids are fans of Cake Boss, My wife had to stop here and grab some pastries to feel part of the experience. We sat in a not so long line that just took forever 1 hour minimum. The shop located inside the Venetian casino sells several pastries running anywhere from 4 - $15 you can also purchase smaller pastries by the pound. The shop is nicely decorated you can see people preparing items from the window while you stand in line. There is a worker controlling the flow of the line at times she brought out samples to calm people while they wait. This was a nice touch. There are not a lot of choices once you get to the counter. My wife ordered the lobster tail, canolli, pecan chocalate covered cookie, velvet cupcake and some cookies that you could purchase per pound. The lobster tail was good not great not worth the wait, pecan cookie had better, the canolli was very good enjoyed the custard, the rest of the items were meh. I forget the pricing but I know it was expensive for what we received. I did not finish the pecan cookie, the lobster tail was ok but that also was not completely devoured. The only thing we finished was the canolli. I would not be back, Ive been to much better bake shops back home. Extraordinary desserts, Somecrust Bakery, to name a few.",0
"My sister in law, who lives in Las Vegas, is obsessed with this bakery so we had high hopes and waited in line in their cramped space for about 15-20 minutes (which is not unusual, I was told). Unfortunately, all the treats we tried tasted like frying oil and nothing else. I couldn't even finish the lobster tail. I've had a few cannoli's from Modern Pasty and Mike's in Boston as well as Madonia's in NYC, so I have tried some amazing cannoli's and lobster tails. Unfortunately, I did not taste any good cannoli or lobster tails at Carlo's Bakery.",0
"Ummm, I had such high expectations of Carlo's Bakery. Not that a SUPERfan of the show, ok more like a mini-fan; but I used to watch on the regular from time to time. Now the show will end the same way, not only a display of a beautiful cake but also DELICIOUS...right? Like that one place that starts with a F - and ends with - 'S, I eat the crumbs its so good, but this is not a review about that bakery, this is about Carlo's Bakery. I'm not saying that it was bad, but it wasn't good...to me, and yes I had THAT LOOK on my face because I was sadly disappointed. We order a canoli and some kind of coconut cookie. Let's start off with the COOKIE, toasted coconut shortbread cookie; toasted coconut and shortbread, you can't go wrong. Wrong, actually you can go very wrong with this. A very pretty looking cookie, golden brown, with a nice dollop of chocolate smack dab in the middle of the cookie. Just me personal opinion, maybe if it was a chocolate ganache it would've helped with the dryness of the cookie. Yes, shortbread is a dry cookie but you definitely get the butter taste on the palate when you eat it. This is a tea/coffee type of cookie, to me it was just bad all over. Super dry, we try to break the cooking in half to split, cookie so hard that when we finally broke the cookie in half, from the force of trying to break the cookie I dropped 1 half on the nasty strip sidewalk. No 5second rule here, that will just have to sit there. Flavor, well I could taste the toasted coconut and the chocolate was just there, that's all I have for that. Traditional Canoli: Once again, I promise I don't know what was up with yesterday's batch, but the 2 items that were purchased were hella overbaked and super hard. Canoli should be a light crisp, hard enough to maintain structure to absorb the filling and not soften the shell but not where your back molars might be cracked after taking a bite. We looked like a hot mess trying to share this canoli on the strip, we pretty much just blended in with the other tourists. Now, the CREAM FILLING now that was DELISH! A nice velvet cream, with a hint of cinnamon, so light - oh I would go back for the cream filling and cream filling only, give me a spoon and a bowl. As for me going back, meh....maybe, since the bakery is mainly known for their cakes then maybe I should a slice of cake instead of the other delectable delicatessens in this shop. The RED VELVET cake did look good, but.... ....let me think about this one, hmm - Red Velvet Cake, huh?",0
We wanted to try it out on Sunday but the line was way too long. So the next time when we showed up and there was no line we bought a couple items. Do not know what the excitement is about this place. Not all that tasty and way overpriced. Will not go there again. Many other tasty pastry items on the strip.,0
"I really wanted to like this place, being a fan of the Cake Boss show. The pastries in the display looked delicious. But the looks were deceiving. The pastries were dry and just so-so. Even the famous cannolis were disappointing. Worst of all, they neglected to put the almond croissant I had ordered and paid for in the box they handed me. By the time I realized this, I was already on my way out of Vegas! Mediocre pastries at an expensive price. No wonder there were no other customers when I arrived at the store.",0
"Instead of 1 star, I'll give this place 2stars as it's not always fair for reality stars getting unrealistic expectations with their food. We got the cannoli, lobster tail, fondant cookies and 7 layer cookie last Dec 22 at noon. They were not bad but it's not special. I guess it was expensive because of the rent they pay at The Venetian. They were mostly dry and crumbly. You only go here just so you can tell your friends that you've been here. The pastries were nothing special. Service should have made up for it but no. Only the cashier with an east coast accent was nice. The rest - I don't know who hired them. Their human resources should reassess their standards. These girls shouldn't be customer facing. They were just dry and borderline rude to customers. The least they should do is to thank their customers for waiting. Even those doing the cakes were snobby. We are not doing them a favor. There are others who would do a better job than you and actually need a job. Just my 2¢.",0
I have debated even writing this review because the situation was tainted with a mistake I made but overall terrible service. I purchased $50 of cannolis and lobster tails. I didn't realize they needed to be refrigerated. I thought it was similar to a cupcake. I didn't realize it was made with cheese. My bad. I don't fault the store but they all went bad except the cannoli I ate right after leaving which was okay tasting. As for line. Only 3 or 4 in front of me. I told them 2 cannolis and 4 lobster tails. They said they only had the lobster tails in hazelnut so I said that was fine. Then they went in back to get them and I didn't realize they had to wait for them to bake and fill them. Took 20 minutes and nobody came out to check on me or tell me a time frame. I only knew because of the see through glass. Then it all spoiled. Such a waste of time and money l.,0
"I really wanted to like this place since I'm a big fan of his show. I got a lobster tail, cannoli and eclair was about $17 ish. Ordering process was a bit different than some bakeries. The Lobster tail was ok kind of tasted stale but the filling was good. Eclair and cannoli both tasted stale with no flavor, both the fillings were like tooth paste and dry like it had too much corn starch instead of a custard taste. I'm still a fan just probably came on Very bad day of baked goods.",0
"I went here for my birthday the line wait was not as bad as I thought. I went on a Friday and we waited for like about 20 minutes. However, the prices are outrageous everything that's cake is $10.00 and above. The only good thing I tasted was the lobster tail. The lobster tail is a must have! This place was not what I expected! I actually had high expectations of it and watching all the seasons and how you hear Buddy talking about his pastries, seems like they are the best pastries you would ever have and No! The pastries are average! There is better local bakeries you can go to around your area that will have better pastries than here to be honest!! The best thing you can purchase is a lobster tail..",0
"I am writing this about a terrible experience at Venetian on 7/14/2018. We were in Vegas, from Chicago, for my little sisters 21st birthday party that had been planned months ago. My sister is a huge fan of Carlo's Bakery, and since there is a cake shop in Vegas, thought we would surprise her with a Cake Boss cake for her 21st. To say I was DISAPPOINTED is a GROSS under statement. I pre-ordered (7/11/18) a makeup mania cake, Order # 154086312, to be ready at 3pm. Choose 3pm as we had a a 4-course, open bar family style SURPRISE dinner with our group of 17 at buca di beppo in Excalibur. Jenelle, the guest of honor, would be ARRIVING at 4pm. Arrived at 3:20p and was SHOCKED to learn cake was NOT READY!! Supervisor looked surprised we were even there. TO MY HORROR AND SHOCK, staff STARTED working on cake at 3:25p. Decorations were rushed and fondant was wet, uneven, smudged. Jenelle's name was so poorly written could barely make it out. Observers were commenting on the poor quality of decorations as my $205.68 cake was being made. The cake was similar to online picture, but some fondant items were completely left off and replaced by random circles to fill up space. The tip of the brush had fallen off, was on bottom of cake box and I had to pinch it back on myself. Her name Jenelle, was barely recognizable. Manager seemed to be unbothered stated he thought the order was for 4pm, which is completely unacceptable. Offered a free cappuccino for wait, which was a smack in the face. The cake was not ready until 4pm! My husband and I missed the being there for the ""surprise"" at dinner for my only sister. Due to the cake be unacceptably frustratingly late, we arrived at dinner at 4:30pm. I NEVER would have ever guessed the GREAT Carlo's Bakery could drop the ball so bad and present us with such a sub-par decorated cake. I am absolutely pissed that our over $200 cake from Carlo's was so poorly mismanaged and was visibly low quality. I have ordered cakes from Jewel that were better decorated and ready for pick-up on time! Needless to say, we HAD to take the cake due to circumstances. I had such high expectations of Carlo's that were completely shattered. Being a fan for so long and FINALLY being able to buy a cake for my sister's surprise 21 st birthday, I was mad and let down to the point of tears. I WILL NEVER PRE-ORDER A CAKE WITH CARLO'S AGAIN, AND NEITHER WILL THE 17 PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE TO WITNESS THIS DISASTER. ERROR WAS 100% CARLO'S BAKERY FAULT AND THE POORLY DECORATED CAKE UNACCEPTABLE. I know that Buddy would NEVER allow this to happen! I have attached pictures of the cake along with picture of text I sent my mom proving me had missed being there for the 4pm ""surprise"" dinner (text time in pictures has switched to Central time, time in Vegas was 4:29pm).",0
"Food is great! Service is horrible...workers aren't friendly.....no menu for the coffee they can make.....once you finally get your order, there's no place to sit and enjoy.",0
"After being gone from the Las Vegas scene for a few years I was amazed at how many new celebrity owned restaurants had popped up. My boyfriend and I both have huge sweet tooths and knew that we wanted to visit Carlos bakery before we left Vegas. We had heard that the lines for this place tended to be long but when we went mid morning it wasn't too bad. I think we waited for about 20 minutes. The staff here were friendly and fast. They also didn't rush the customers giving you plenty of time to look through all of the bakery cases. We wanted to try everything but ended up choosing a few treats instead. We ordered the glazed donut, carrot cupcake, cannoli, sugar cookie, chocolate chip cookie, and the m&m cookie. Honestly nothing tasted as good as we were expecting. We ended up spending almost $20 here and the only thing worth mentioning was the glazed donut. The cupcake tasted frozen and all of the cookies were dry and hard. We were definitely let down.",0
"Tried to order a cheesecake for my bf's bday. I was told to go on their postmates app if I wanted delivery. Went through their whole menu (pretty long) and didn't see any cheesecake. Called back to ask if they offer cheesecake because I didn't see it on the app menu, & the girl said they definitely do. Went back to the postmates app and checked again and did not see the cheesecake ANYWHERE. I'm kinda bummed cause I really had my heart set on this place for my bf's cake. Hopefully the manager sees this so they can fix their menu. Or maybe the girl is just mistaken & needs to know their inventory better?",0
Wish I'd read the reviews and seen the yelp rating before going here. Got the rainbow cake because it looked so good. Below average at best.,0
"Overhyped and underwhelming. Unlike other yelpers, the line wasn't terribly long and moved quickly. They had a plethora of options to choose from, all of which looked good. However, the cupcakes themselves were disappointing. The cake was relatively dry and lacked flavor. At nearly $5 a piece, I've experienced better at most other bakeries selling for the same price. This place is busy and popular due to the TV show. Otherwise, this place would be a bakery to skip over when looking for dessert on the strip.",0
I tried their Cannoli and it was horrible no chocolate on the end the cream tasted sour the shell was stale The Chocolate Chip cookie was very hard felt like it was going to break my teeth my friends had Walnut Wedge and Chocolate meringue cookie their treats were just as bad as ours Buddy better hire some good cooks or will fail as of now there is no reason to come back to many staff behind the counter and not taking orders 1 star is being generous,0
"The place was disorganized. As I was waiting to place my order, I noticed a fly inside the food case. It landed on a cupcake. The staff couldn't care about placing an order. Once I finally got my order, the cupcake was dry. It appeared to be a day old. I'm not going here again and I don't recommend it.",0
This place is retail at its lowest. Saturday night here with a huge line. They had one person behind the bakery desk who was singing along while 20+ guests are waiting. Clearly nobody understands the importance of expediting the long line. Terrible. Where is the manager on duty?,0
"Really disappointed. Waited for awhile, paid $9.00 for a piece of cake that was just OK. Nothing special about the taste at all!! It was pretty, I ordered the rainbow cake, but I've had better cake from the local grocery store. Probably will never go back.",0
"If you watched Cake Boss, Carlo's Bakery would most likely be on your Vegas bucket list. However, do not believe the hype, people. It is a traditional American-style bakery. Nothing hip nor interesting about the items they carry. We also sampled some of the caked and they tasted average. We still got some pastries to-go to use up our resort credit and left unimpressed. The good - their assortment of biscotti. The mediocre: pretty much everything else.",0
"It makes me sad to write this review. I've been a fan of cakeboss for a while. Meanwhile my wife and I were in New York we passed by his Hoboken New Jersey location. That was overpriced and under delivered big time. We got there late so there was not much selection. I wanted to give him another shot when we were in Vegas. My wife wanted to try his lobster tails and I wanted the cannoli. We got 4 lobster tails, one cannoli, and one eclair. Unfortunately it was the same thing as last time. The lobster tails were overcooked, the cannoli cream had little flavor, and the eclair tasted worst than store bought. I'm not sure what's up with Carlos. As a business owner I would be paying attention to the reviews. All of his locations have low performing reviews. Yet, either he's not paying attention or doesn't care. I'm not sure but I don't believe he deserves the title of cake boss with horrible desserts like the overpriced once I've tried. This is my opinion. Save your time and money.",0
"I have tried to go to this bakery for years and everytime I visited the line was crazy. This week however there was no line so I decided to have a taste. I had the hazelnut croissant and a brownie with pecans and caramel. For a bakery with such hype, I was sadly disappointed in the quality. The croissant was over stuffed with hazelnut cream so it ended up oozing everywhere. The brownie also had only a couple of nuts on top with a little drizzle of caramel. The actual brownie was more like cake than a brownie.",0
Would have given no star but one star is the lowest star possible...have to be honest worst cupcakes I have ever had and I've had a whole-lot-a bad cupcakes...frosting had no flavor (not even sure they used butter or sugar) and cake was beyond dry and again with zero flavor...it's sad they are stealing people's money by selling horrible cupcakes,0
"I wanted to make custom cakes from them, but they have a HORRIBLE response time in replying to Email orders. I called and asked to make several custom cakes for friends of mine and they mentioned to email the request. I sent out an email request and received one reply out of the 4 emails I sent. The response time to that one email was a week later. Expect long waits throughout the day, with a shortage of staff. Workers are all still in training mode and incapable of dealing with large volume orders and dealing with crowds. Wait a few more weeks before going here, and hopefully they'll get their operation in order. Current management is poor, and don't bother emailing them Cake requests. PreMade cakes on the other hand turned out well. I picked up 2 of them for a friends birthday, and all thought the cake was delicious! one Star for that.",0
"Cue the music! Sugar...ohh Buddy Buddy. You are a candyman.., and you got me forgetting youuuu. I'll keep it short and sweet (unlike the lines and the pastries for sale here). Bland. Overhyped. Not worth the wait. Or the money. Or the calories. A handful of mediocre cookies and pastries; $15.00. Two important life lessons taken away from this horrible place; priceless. Lesson 1. If you're ever feeling down, just remember that as long as you have a personality, everything else will be just fine. Lesson 2. Money really does buy nice things; including, but not limited to, one hell of a Marketing Director.",0
These cupcakes were so pretty looking bit very dry as Hell. The icing was Awesome! Too Bad Cupcake Boss but your Cupcakes Sucks!!,0
"We went to Carlos after a delicious lunch at Buddy V's. Beautiful place and pretty pastries, but when we got to our hotel and tried them everything was terrible, and that's me being nice. We had a brownie, super dry, a shortbread/sugar cookie w chocolate icing and choc chip cookie. Both cookies were sooooo dry and we just couldn't believe how bad they were. The packaging and all were so pretty but looks were DECEIVING!",0
"I bought a cannoli and cupcake. The cannoli was mediocre, the shell was stale and too much filling. The cupcake was also stale. If you are going to pride yourself on being a top notch bakery don't serve stale products, waste of money.",0
"Disappointed. Just had a red velvet cupcake and I've actually had better from a grocery store bakery at home. The cake was very bland and the abundant icing was just saccharin sweet with no flavor aside from pure sugar. I grew up in NJ and hope that Carlos' more traditional confections are better, because this cupcake was an embarrassment to my heritage.",0
"The strawberry short cake and confetti cake were good, however the Sprinkled sugar cookies had no taste. Peanut butter cookie was okay,but still very generic, can buy cookies at the supermarket that taste the same and much less expensive. It was an experience to try, but I do not think I will try again.",0
Line too long & the staff too slow. Such a bummer!,0
This place is nothing great than a regular bakery you find at the end of every street in america. They have very limited selection of pastries and they tasted mediocre. The cup cakes werent perfectly iced and they were sliding . Not a big fan of their work.overpriced and over hyped,0
"Ordered $30 in pastries and cookies and would have been better off buying from a gas station convenience store. They were stale, flavorless and artificial.",0
Was recently in Vegas and wanted to drop by to visit the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss. It was actually very disappointing and a huge let down. All I tried was the chocolate cannoli so maybe I didn't have the right thing but... It was sold in a pack of 6 for $30. The favor was not there and it just tasted frozen. It left a weird aftertaste too that was also unpleasant. I would say Carlos Bakery is a pass!,0
My kids have watched every episode of cake boss as well as his reality tv show for the next great cake boss. We were so excited to experience the bakery while visiting Vegas. The cake we bought was horrible. It was stale and dry. The cakes at the local supermarkets are better. I will never visit again. My kids didn't even eat their dessert.,0
"Service is really slow. We just went to order a cupcake from the bakery case. After ordering they put the cupcake on a plate and put it to the side. We then waited for over ten minutes to pay, while the man behind took additional orders. It was particularly annoying because there was no one else waiting in front of us to be rung out. The cupcake itself was pretty dry and disappointing, not worth the wait.",0
"Super excited to try their pastries cause cake boss! Line wasn't too bad at 3 pm on a Saturday. About 15 min wait. They had cool displays of fondant cake that you can see as you wait in line. You can also watch bakers bake through the window next to the storefront. A bit pricey, around $4-5 for one pastry. I tried the cookies and cream lobster tail. Expected the lobster tail to be light and flaky but tasted stale and hard to bite into. My friends' lobster tails were also stale tasting. Hope I have a better experience next time.",0
"Unwelcoming staff, disgusting, stale, overpriced pastries. The show and artistry is awesome but I'm glad I was able to catch this place without a line during their downtime. I would've been real upset if I had to fall in line for this.",0
All I had was their infamous lobster tail. Cream tasted good but the pastry tasted old. Will not go back. I'm disappointed because I love watching the show and always wanted to try buddy's pastry .,0
"I'm sorry buddy I can only hope this gets to you and you take this seriously. Please go to shop in vegas and try everything. My grocery store (publix) blows your carrot cake. I bout butter cookies to take to my kids and I threw them away as soon as I tasted them , bland with no butter taste. Its hard to accept criticism but I truly believe I am doing you a service. If you don't do anything to change you will see that no matter how much you are on tv customers will stop coming. If you need help I'm happy to assist.",0
"Sadly, not like his 'mamma used to make at all' I'm Italian and know what I'm talking about. The cannoli' sadly, are very disappointing. No taste of ricotta. Filled with artificial flavoring a and cream. Not one bit nice. Sorry!",0
"In a word, ""meh"". Had the lobster tail, chocolate canoli and a cookie. The cookie tasted like it was a day old. The canoli was hard and tasteless. And the lobster tail was runny and lackluster. The staff was also unemotional, and stale. I'm a big fan of Next Great Baker but this was a huge disappointment. I feel like Buddy would be ashamed of this place.",0
The appearance and awww of this bakery I found to be slightly misleading. Upon entering I was blown away with the presentation of the baked items. After a little thinking I bought 3 cupcakes and a donut. Cupcakes were fair. First they were cold. Not really interested in cold cake. The icing was.. ok. The cake taste like it had mildew fish water. Not one but all cupcakes. Glazed donuts-only reason I'd return,0
"Disappointed. I had visited Carlo's Bakery on a previous trip to Las Vegas and had a good experience. So good in fact, I knew it was a must stop on my recent trip there. However, I was not impressed and neither were my friends. We each got a cupcake though there weren't many flavors to choose from but you could never go wrong with chocolate or vanilla right?! Mind you, we went at 9:30 at night but Vegas is the city that never sleeps! Our cupcakes were dry and hard! If you're a Cakeboss fan and must stop here in Vegas, plan to stop early when the desserts are likely more fresh.",0
"This place was HORRIBLE! We got the crumb cake, cheesecake, and nut bar thing. The nut bar thing almost broke my teeth! The crumb cake was SO DRY and so BLAND! The cheesecake was nothing special. Cheesecake Factory is 20 times better! Too pricey for NOT good quality. DO NOT GO HERE! Bouchon Bakery is THE BEST bakery in Vegas right now. Carlo's was the worst disappointment for this local.",0
We ordered a cookies and cream cake and Italian cheesecake. The cake was very bland just sugar tasting. The cake wasn't moist: for $10 a slice I expected a much better cake. The Italian cheesecake was not much better. A very soggy crust .,0
"I have been a fan of ""Cake Boss"" for quite some time now so when I found out about this location in Las Vegas, I was beyond excited! After years of wanting to try it out, I finally went on my birthday (07/11/18) and I was disappointed! The line was long & service was terribly slow. I tried the lobster tail and the triple chocolate chip cookies, worst I've ever had! I will definitely not go back again!",0
"Not worth it! My husband and I stopped by and got a vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing and a slice of chocolate cake. Cupcake: I would much rather have a Walmart cupcake. The icing had no flavor and the cupcake had to of been a day or two old, it was soo dry. Chocolate cake: it was moist but lacked something. The service was good, everyone was friendly and helpful. Needless to say I was so disappointed, I had high hopes for this place!",0
"Awful stale pastries! They should be ashamed selling them! Eclair was so stale I took one bite and threw it away. They should be ashamed charging that much for inedible ""food"".",0
"Had really high expectations from this brand name being a die hard fan of Buddy Valastro....but was so heartbroken and disappointed not once but twice with their products. Cannoli had a grainy cream filling with soggy pastry. Lobster tails were chewy and almost took 1 min to eat one bite, and also the filling was stinky. Hazelnut puff had a nice filling but yet again the pastry was horribly wet n soggy. Lemon puffs were nice with a good amount of filling and decent pastry. Cupcakes were dry and frosting was like the storebought sugar creams.",0
I was so happy to know that the bakery was in my hotel. What a disappointment!! I went there to get something for my birthday. I got the red velvet cupcake and the creampuff lobster tail. The red velvet cup cake was very salty and the lobster tail was stale was not even flaky at all. My husband had the vanilla cupcake and he said it was all right it was and all that. Very disappointed.,0
Very upset that they didn't let's us know ahead of Time that they where out of cannoli !,0
"This review is based on my service. After coming here and spending a lot of money trying different pastries I made sure to ask if they got everything. They assured me everything was in the bag. I took their word and headed back on an 8 hour drive back to NorCal. Fast foward...get home my kids wanted their pastery for dessert and we were missing some. I paid for pastries that I didn't receive, not happy at all, this place is not the cheapest and now that was money wasted.",0
All I wanted was a good cannoli from here and I was extremely disappointed!! I go to the one in Orlando all the time and never have any of these problems. First and the main reason I came was to get a cannoli. They have zero and informed me that they haven't had any for two days and won't be getting any more any time soon. So how does this happen? The girl had nothing to say. Since they didn't have that I chose to have a cookie and it had a stale like taste to it and was horrible. I don't know if I can trust Carlo's bakery anymore which is a shame I was a huge fan.,0
"Place is too expensive. 3 items for $27.00. I was surprised. I got cookies and a little cheese cake. I was excited to try them because it was pretty expensive...But when I did, it was pretty average.. it didn't blow my mind.",0
"Was looking for a great cupcake in Vegas, unfortunately I didn't find it at Carlo's. The cake was dry and the frosting was thick, heavy and way too sweet. The brownie was okay, once I scraped off the frosting. Chocolate mousse cake was okay, again heavy, dense mousse. And to top it off we paid over 20 bucks for 2 cupcakes, a brownie and mini mousse cake, which would have been worth it, if it had all been delicious. Love the show, but not the cakes.",0
Italian bakery with no cannoli & tiramisu? What a disappointment. No wonder there's no line waiting in front of the store anymore.,0
Very keen to visit the store after watching the show. But was neither impressed by the visual appeal of the desserts nor the taste. Not worth the money. Our local bakeries do a better job.,0
So I came to Las Vegas to celebrate my best friends birthday and I decided to go and get her cake from here .....I thought she love strawberries so let's get a cake with some it or in it .....simple right ?!?! Nope not at all all the cakes that had strawberries were I lil off the strawberries looked old but I think maybe they just got a lil dryed out .....nope old as the Vegas strip.....molded as well just gross a cake full of moldy strawberries.....I am so displeased by this don't go here if u want a fresh cake !!!!,0
"Very disappointing. For the cake boss, this place is a complete step in the wrong direction. I ordered cannolis which were bland and dry. I ordered lobster tails which were absolutely disgusting. The sfogliatelle, which they are usually very good at making, were not available. This was in the morning when the bakery should be ready to go at 10:30 AM. The service is just OK. I can't see people who work there seem excited to be there. I think they are just there. It is right opposite Buddy V's restaurant. It is very expensive. For eight lobster tails pastries and six cannolis, it was $74. Expensive! The worst part is that people who tried everything when I brought it over were less than impressed, and I was less than impressed as well. I am surprised this bakery is still open because I have been several times and I have been disappointed pretty much every time. I finally felt that it was appropriate to write a review because I've been here at least five times and cannot say I've ever been all that impressed. Very expensive yet not that great.",0
I was very disappointed to learn that 99% of their items are frozen and then thawed or baked then decorated. Certainly not worth my money when there are a number of bakeries in Vegas and on the strip that offer freshly made items daily and don't require a ridiculous wait in line. This place is more of a novelty than a quality bakery. Not impressed with any of the items I've had from this place. Save your time and money and go to Bouchon Bakery instead.,0
Wow very disappointed!!! As i watch the show cake boss i craved for his sweets... once i tried.... was not expecting the prices to be this high and the quality of what i got was horrible... i had 3 different things and my boyfriend and i took ONE bite and end up throwing the rest away!!! The price of those 3 small things was almost $20. Was definitely not what i was expecting... wouldn't come back,0
I definitely expected more from this bakery. Being that buddy v is a celebrity patisserie chef. The lobster tail is hard and has no taste to it. The oatmeal raisin cookie looks delicious but is tasteless. I won't be going back anytime soon.,0
"Overpriced crappy cupcakes. $4 each, 30 min wait - and you can get much better cupcakes at Walmart. These were bland & dry - don't waste your money.",0
"im a fan of Cake Boss :-) with that being said i was excited to have pastry from Carlo's. I shouldn't have been. Let me tell you about my experience. The bakery is located across the way from the restraunt. The restraunt isn't crowded the bakery however is crazy!!! When you're facing the bakery to the left is an open viewing area of the pastry chefs hard at work. Very nice touch especially because people always enjoy seeing exactly how their food is made and prepared. However not a nice touch when the open viewing area is bigger than the dessert displays, cash registers, and eating area. Because the dessert displays, cash registers and eating area is cramped into such a small area damn, that line is crazy!!! We waited an hour in line...on a Sunday at 10!! Come to find out due to genius staff or amazing manager....the open viewing area had 2 staff members both slowing filling pastries and the hectic, crazy customer service side had 3 cashiers...ummm tell the manager that only one person needs to fill pastries!! Or, even better use of time, energy, and effort is that after 10 stop filling pastries!! I mean the damn place closes at 11 and ur open how long during the day? i think during the morning and afternoon u should b able to fill enough damn pastries. Omg!! so frustrating. i we were in line for an hour! and we were really onlu 10 people deep into the line. 10 people should've a walk in the part...uh, no it wasnt. the pastry was good...but it wasnt wait 1 hour good. after waiting 1 hour i thought it would be amazing. after this i realized i shouldnt expect much. my husband said the following in reflection of his carlo's bakery experience. he said if u forget about the crazy prices, the hour wait, the cute red and white ribbon thats on the box and cake boss the tv show in general. if u close ur eyes and take a bite of the cupcakes...one word comes to mind ""Safeway."" as in Safeway supermarket. he hit the nail right on the head.",0
"Horrible!!!! And this place was on Cake Boss, not worthy of the line you have to wait in to try pastries that taste like they are store bought. I've had fresher tasting pastries at the local Starbuck's. The celebrity status has most definitely gotten to the heads of the management at this bakery. $10 for a personal cheesecake that doesn't taste like anything and the cannoli ......... OMG what a disaster, the cannoli tastes like you are biting into gritty sugary whip cream with a shell that seems to have been made days ago not fresh at all. Try a local bakery instead, they put more love into what they are serving versus the""Cake Boss"" who obviously is only after the dollars. My family and I will not be back to this place guaranteed!!!!!! Don't waste your time or your money!!!!!",0
Just bought some pastries... haven't eaten them though. Just thought to comment on their packaging . Really disappointing . Hope the taste will make up for it.,0
"My hubby and I went today and like a lot of other helpers here stated.... Yep it was a line. Mind you it's Tuesday around 8:18pm. But please get a number as soon as you see the line because that's who they go about receiving your order. I got the California cheesecake which was okay and was nothing to rave about, I also got the vanilla buttercream icing cupcake which was a little dry, and the salted caramel cupcake which was HORRIBLE!!!!! The line isn't worthy it whatsoever. Please save your money and find another bakery. I'm still in search of a really good one.",0
"Went there at 750am before they opened. There was a line. Not impressed with it at all. Decided to try it for a second time the next day. Got there at 815am, didn't walk out till 9am. Same disappointment in the goods, not good. Not recommending unless you have lots of time to kill for average baked goods. Way over rated. It must be their marketing tactic to create a line outside because they work slow compared to norm. No sense of urgency or efficiency. They ate slow!!! They write down your order instead of pulling it out from the case as you tell them, then they have you wait while they grab your order n box it. Then you go up to this really sweet cashier lady who is at the same or slower pace. N when you are ready to eat your 40 min wait goods, there's nothing wowing to it. Super average!",0
it was SO overpriced. the pasties were good but honestly wayyyyyyy too expensive... friendly servers but again...unnecessarily expensive. probably will never come back because of how expensive it is however the lobster tails were yummy.,0
"Dessert was ok...but not worth the 45 minute wait. The ladies working there had the most dysfunctional system just to get us some cookies and cupcakes. After salivating over desserts in the ridiculously long line for about 30 minutes, my sisters and I ordered a few items each. The young lady writes down the order (chocolate chip cookie) on a post it and someone else fulfills that very complicated order. It's wrapped with love and placed in a bag...and then...since you waited so long, you order one more baked goody. They proceed through steps 1-3 again. We then wait for another 10 minutes to have our order entered into the cash register. I ordered coffee and my sisters were booing and throwing things at me. ""Why would you order something else...we've been here all day!"" Tip: throw the freakin cookie in a bag, ring me up, and get me on my way. 3 minutes tops",0
I was very excited about this place as my daughter loves the show Cake Boss. We stood in a line that didn't move. I wondered off from my group to look at the front display case where there was a cock roach crawling over some carrot cake squares. Needless to say.. we exited the line immediately.,0
Its not wort it the time and those prices $$$$$$$30 dollars for a cupcake cheessecake mini and a mini tiramisu its crazy and the flavor not good its just the name,0
"I've read great reviews on this place and still see friends suggesting it to other friends heading to Vegas, but we were not impressed to say the least. The cake was terribly dry and obviously way over priced. Would skip this and just enjoy desert at one of the fine dining that is readily available in Vegas.",0
"I had a cupcake from here and it was absolutely awful. If the line wasn't so long I would have returned it. I took 2 bites and tossed it. The cake was dry and the frosting was hard. When I say dry - I mean it was dry like it had been left out for a few days because it was hard. My Betty Crocker cupcakes with Betty Crocker frosting are much better than the softball I received. I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to it. Waste of time, money and calories!",0
"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! We purchased some baked goods here and turns out they didn't include them in the bag! :( I even contacted them using their website and the only response I received was, ""at which location did this happen"" and of course I responded, but never heard from them again! Pretty disappointed especially when we paid for these expensive treats! Shame on you Carlo's Bake Shop! This was certainly not a great first time visit experience! :(",0
"Very busy and unorganized! Grab a number, weave your way to the display case to look at the eye candy and wait about 20+ min in a small cramped shop for your number to be called. I ended up getting a lobster tail, California cheesecake, and crumb cake. Waited another 15+ min for my name to be called so I can pay. There isn't a line for anything, so you really need to pay attention what they're calling out. Ended up being around $25 for those three items. Lobster tail was eh, cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard. California cheesecake was nothing special or unique. The crumb cake was the most disappointing, it tasted like a dry sponge with brown sugar lumps on top, not even kidding. Don't waste your time or money here.",0
"First and last time coming here. The staff are very unhappy looking, rude, didn't even welcome us. A lot of people come here from watching the show Cake Boss, but we were very dissappointed. Food was not to our expectation, very bland taste and undercooked. Lastly, the waiter we had asked us if he could KEEP the change. Instead of waiting for his tip. Very rude and disrespectful. We will not be coming here again.",0
"Super over rated, after 40 minutes in line I was expecting something way better, the food is average and pricey",0
I visited Carlo's Bakery while in Las Vegas last weekend. The desserts behind the counter looked scrumptious so I ordered one cannoli and a lobster tail. The desserts were a disappointment. I won't be back!,0
The smell of butter is very strong you look great but the taste is very mediocre compared to the price,0
"I brought my children along with 2 nephews to Las Vegas for my sons birthday. They were excited to go to the bakery. On Saturday we got there and got #67 they were on 25 an hour later they were on number 33. The staff was extremely slow and seemed to be in no rush whatsoever. Sunday morning we went again at 830am thinking they wouldn't have such a long wait, and again we got number 67! This time they were on number 47... This is what I don't understand if they have two people helping the customers and they each take 10-15 minutes per customer then the cashier isn't doing anything for 10 minutes at a time. After 30 minutes we left they only moved up 4 numbers. My son was extremely disappointed and it was a sour end to his birthday. A person would think that they would put at least 4 people during peek times.",0
"First, I was so happy to come to have the Cake Boss bakery. I was there August 6. While we were waiting in line. They were advertising that if you spent so much that you would get a water bottle or a coffee mug. Well, They ran out, but had some on the shelf. You didn't know they had run out. The cashier stated that they didn't have any more. I ask her if I could have he one on the shelf. She said no we don't have any more! I could not believed that she was so rude. I spent over $25. I got horrible service and I didn't get my water bottle. I still want it! The desert I did get was very good. I don't see myself ever going back due to the very bad customer service.",0
"Worst customer service ever. DO NOT use a Credit Card here (SCAM). Was there on Saturday Oct 3, 2015 evening with my family. We decided to buy a few pastries which should have costed under $20. Gave the credit card to the cashier and she charge me $60. Only then, did she noticed that she charged me for one TRAY of lobster tails instead ONE lobster tail. Fine, I asked that she just cancel and recharge my CC and I will on my way. Her reply was ""No, it was our store policy to only give store credit. But if I paid in cash, I could have given you cash back. You must take store credit"" Then I asked to speak to Josh the manager. He was the rudest and most incompetent manager ever. Every time I would try to put a word in, his responds was ""No it was our store policy to only give store credit."" This must have been his respond for about 10 times like a robot. So I asked if him, ""if he was to have shopped at another merchant, and was missed charged $5000, how would he like to be given store credit only?"" This is a matter of principle not the $45 that was over charged. I asked, ""if you can not give store credit, can you give me back $45 in cash?"" This is when Josh's incompetence comes in to play. His respond, ""I can't, my books will be off by $45."" Again, he didn't care, As a manager of store, one has to be accommodating and think outside the box. But Carlos' management can't. Gave up, walked out without any pastries and a lost of $60. If a store is forcing a customer to take store credit because of their mistake, it is STEALING.",0
"We were really looking forward to experiencing Carlos bakery. Waiting over 30 minutes to get inside was totally doable. Everything looked sooo good! However, everything we tried (cannoli, crumb bun, chocolate chip cookie, triple choc chip cookie, apple turnover and coconut macaroon) EVERYTHING was tasteless. Not worth the $39.00 spent nor the time. Just save the time and money, take some pics and call it a day!",0
"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED WITH MY SLICE OF RED VELVET CAKE! I was really excited to find this bakery, which wasn't easy for us to find, and had such high expectations because of who owns it! He's FAMOUS for cake, right? And red velvet is my FAVORITE CAKE EVER! I saw it there and couldn't wait to buy it and dig in! IT SERIOUSLY IS THE WORST TASTING RED VELVET CAKE, OR CAKE PERIOD, THAT I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE and I have had plenty of cake in my lifetime! Even the frosting was gross. If I could give it ZERO stars I would. What a letdown!!!! I highly discourage any travelers to Vegas to waste your time or money at Carlo's Bakery!! I know we will never go back!",0
"Carlos bakery is over-hyped and overpriced, with declining quality over the past year or so. I ordered a chocolate hazelnut birthday cake on-line 1 month in advance so there's no excuse for a shoddy job they did on the icing and lettering (which had to be re-done since the original didn't even spell the name correctly). The cake had more icing than cake, with no hazelnut flavor at all so it was a basic chocolate with the quality that you could get at a grocery store. And what was that pearly kernel in the icing?! I've purchased the white cake from the case several times which was better than the pre-ordered cake. Also, they do not seem to care about return local customers, so I will not be giving them any future business!",0
"Take a number and be prepared to wait and wait and wait some more! So after a 45 min. wait I was hoping for amazing cannoli's and for the price we paid, let's just say I was looking for Buddy himself, because I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to have made them! However I wound up paying $3.50 per cannoli for a giant disappoint and the pleasure of waiting 45 min. in a small crowded bakery along with a ton of other people who were all crowded in on top of each other so we could try to hear our numbers being called because if you missed your number they weren't going to call it again! And it wasn't like you could make your selection or look at the case while you were waiting because the people were so crowded into the bakery like sardines that they were all up on the case blocking it from view from everyone. When your number was called you had to push your way through just to look at the case to see what they even had, but the selection was pretty dismal anyway so it really didn't matter. Your choices were cookies, mini cheese cakes, cannoli's, chocolate covered strawberries or lobster tails. For being such a well known bakery the selection was awful. As for the Carlos Bakery amazing cannoli recipe, they just average and the cookies were just cookies. I will say that the Lobster Tail was pretty good though, but I would never wait in that crazy line for another one.",0
Oh wow - I do not even care what the dessert tastes like. We were at the Venetian in Vegas and expected a wait - they took our order in about 20 minutes.... I tried paying but the cashier said - you have to wait and be called?! And not with a nice tone- no name tag so no name... hmmm ... so we waited in another line ... and my kids and the family of kids in front of us were not being called... Others way after us had their orders... ' a five pack of cannolis' a complicated order- especially since it is predefined... get a new cashier with a new attitude...,0
"Over hyped. Their cheesecake has a weird after taste, there are better bakeries out in LA that cost way less than what this place charges. I'm never going back to this nasty place again. Stay away people",0
"I have always visited the bakery every time we go to Las Vegas. In the past I have brought cookies home. (Quite a lot). This time when I went the only butter cookies they has were in a prepackaged plate. In the actual bakery they has larger cookies and dessert. I asked if they were fresh. After being told yes, I purchased three trays, and several boxes to Bri g home. Big big mistake. Cookies were stale and broken into pieces. What a huge waste of time, money, and effort. They used to sell individual butter cookies and cookies in little boxes which were delicious. I should have known by the lack of customers, and no lines at all. Will never waste my money or time there again. Terrible terrible. I threw them all out. Do not throw away your money as I did.",0
"So this is our last day in Vegas and we decided to bring my sister here.this being my second time here I have to say I wouldn't order strawberries as for the chocolate dipped strawberries were made the day before and you could see the strawberries sweating and the strawberries soft I asked if they had new one, yes typical me I want fresh she goes and ask the back comes back says no and laughs while talking to another employee. Will I return maybe. And that's a big maybe",0
"My sisters wanted to try this place out because we are all fans of Cake Boss and Buddy and his family. They tell you the line is about 20 minutes... ummm... you mean over an hour. I was able to go all the way to Wynn, buy something and the LV store and come back when my sisters where just hitting the counter. Good for me, bad for them. You order, then you have to wait to pay. They will call you over to confirm your order once they box it up. Too bad I didn't notice that two of the rugelach cookies were burnt...as in, you should have dumped these cookies in the trash can rather than putting it out to sell - especially @ $12.99 lb! I felt RIPPED OFF. They were running out of Lobster tails - and the person behind us was asked when they were confirming her order if she would mind having two lobster tails removed from her order - I think they oversold - there's a lag between taking customer's orders and filling them which can create issues like this. Skip Carlo's and go to another bakery if you are in this area - Hello, you are in Vegas and there's LOTS of other places to try (Thankfully) and Buddy, I watch your show Buddy's Bakery Rescue and you might want to go to this location and rescue it... I'm just sayin'.....!",0
"Big name, but disappointed in product. My friend and I are local, came down about 7:30 am and was first customer in store. One thing we noticed was the floors looked dirty, especially since the store if fairly new. I realize they are known for their cakes, but I wanted a light buttery croissant, and sadly what I received was a dense dinner roll shaped as a croissant. We had a conoli also, and the filling was quite good but the shell was thick and tasted like it was frozen or stale. We ordered some cashew butter cookies and was hard like a biscotti, maybe it is supposed to be that way. The staff was nice and I'm glad I checked it out, but it was nothing special and didn't WOW me.",0
Really disappointed. Waited in long line and purchased a nice variety of desserts. All tasted the same - no flavor and very processed/mass produced tasting. Do not recommend this bakery at all. Just a tourist trap.,0
"After all the hype of watching Cake Boss (which I know is a different location) we were expecting a lot more from Carlo's Bake Shop in the Venetian. The look is authentic and the glass kitchen a nice touch but the items we tried were just ok. The Peanut Butter & Jelly cookies could be made better in the average kitchen, certainly my homemade cookies beat these hands down. The best thing we had was the vanilla slice (like a mille feuille, can't remember what they called it) the pastry cream was good and the puff pastry thin and well defined. Too many option in Vegas for this to be more than a novelty stop.",0
I was surprised and completely caught off guard because Buddy gets on people on his shows for the quality of a product. I truly hope his original location is not reflected by the Las Vegas location. I ordered the cookies and cream and the carrot cake cupcakes and a chocolate chip cookie. Both cupcakes were a disaster. I cannot believe I stood in line and waited for such a product. It is definitely a tourist trap and I was duped as well. The cookie was the only edible treat.,0
"This place symbolizes overrated businesses glamorized by the media for no justifiable reason: -The Lobster Tail people are ""raving"" about? = It was completely stale with tasteless cream. This is just a cream roll that you can get for cheaper and better in a Chinatown bakery. -Strawberry Shortcake - average. Cream could have used more flavor and tasted less commercial and fattening. -Cookies - we tried one of each and none of them were good. I literally took a bite and threw the rest away. How is it possible to make cookies that aren't good? At this point you might think I sound like a negative snob and I attribute that to the amazing bakeries of San Francisco - so I apologize for having standards. The icing to this cake was that we waited 1+ hour to order & receive and most of the shelves were empty because they were selling faster than they could bake. I'm still mad over the stale lobster tail - especially for the price we paid. Why would you come here?",0
"The strawberry cheesecake was 7/10 (good but not the best). The brownie was 5/10 (just average American pastry with too much sugar and not that much flavor). Coffees were disappointing, below average. The place was disappointing as the place right in front was amazing.",0
So so oooooooo disappointing this place besides the long wait time the staff is rude and pushy to take the order now as a customer and a fan I expected more from this bakery I have always watched the tv show and the pastry look really good but no not at all in this location the cannoli filled with vanilla was not good is was simple no taste now before that I ask one of the staff that was controlling the line what was her suggestion and which one she recommended she simply said oh sry I haven't tried anything yet am new I just been working for around a month wow Carlo bakery you need to let your employees try your pastry how can they recommend or say to customer which item is good if you don't let them try it before the consumer,0
"They have lots of employees but service is too slow. They need to improve efficiency. Didn't like the way the phone customers we instantly put on hold. ""Carlos Bakery, please hold"". You ASK your customers to hold, not tell them. Got 2 cannolis - they were alright.",0
We ordered a chocolate cake for my nephew's fortieth birthday celebration. Even his 8 and 10 year olds couldn't eat it! Never knew a cake could be so dry. Icing was tasteless. The cake was kind of cute with broken Oreos on top. That was the only good part of the cake. Not worth the additional $5 per person charge from our restaurant to cut it for us.,0
"It's just a hype and I don't know why? The salespeople are moving very slow so it will built a longer line, I spent almost $100 just try a few of them but I was so disappointed, save your hard earned cash , not worth it.",0
"I had the chocolate walnut meringue cookie, hazelnut lobster tail, and French cream lobster tail. I was disappointed with the cookie, it didn't have that fall apart on the outside, chewy on the inside type of texture. The fillings for the lobster tails were delicious but the crusts were meh. The pastries didn't seem to be freshly made. Oh pretty expensive. $5.50 per lobster tail.",0
Was very disappointed. We got 3 cupcakes and a carrot cake and 2 cupcakes were rock solid and the frosting was bland. Vanilla cupcake was very dry and lacked flavor. Carrot cake was also dry. We expected more based on the name but I could make a better cupcake from boxed mix.,0
I had the cannoli and this definitely is not a New York cannoli. The impastata was most likely thinned out with whipped cream. I can guarantee Carlos doesn't make their cannoli the same way on the east coast. If they did they would be out of business. I was very disappointed!,0
I was so disappointed since I have been a fan of Carlos Bakery for years watching the TV show. My husband and I went in to get goodies to take back to our son and were not even greeted. The staff today looked like they hated their jobs and we were inconveniencing them by even being there. They had hand written prices on paper taped to the shelves for pricing on the mugs below these beautifully decorated dummy cakes?!?! The floors looked they haven't been clean in a very long time. On a happy note they seemed to take pride in cleaning in the actual kitchen area based on what I saw just not in the customer space. Overall very sad to see a business that prides itself on details be so lax on standards in this Carlos bakery.,0
"I was excited to try out this Bakery that people were inline for at least 2 hours to buy a cake! I called it in a day before and had placed the order and pick it up! 1st the girl answered the phone were very nice but everything i asked she have to put me on hold at least 5min. To check with the Baker, that was happened apparently 3x times during our ordered conversation. Then 2nd when we go and pick up the cake, the cashier rush you out! 3rd when i came home and opened the cake! There wAs a cracked line on the cake! I just want the store know that they should open the box before delivery to the client! The cashier seem to rush me out because they ate busy! But it taste good! But was very disappoint of the decoration!",0
"Hong Kong or should I say I think the Asians make the worst deserts unless they're copying the West. The Europeans make the best deserts on the planet: FACT. Still. This bakery isn't any better than the deserts you buy in Little Italy or Commercial Drive or Broadway (Greek area) in Vancouver, BC Canada so it's not worth the wait in the line along with hipsters and those who ""don't know"".",0
"Went to carlos for the first time and purchased 1/2 dozen lobster tails as well as some chocolate covered strawberries. I had really been looking forward to trying the famous lobster tails only to be beyond disappointed. I don't know if I received an old batch given that I've visited the bakery at 1030am, but they were leathery and tough. I had expected a light crispy flaky pastry and this was not that by any means. The only redeeming quality of them was the pastry cream inside. The chocolate covered strawberries were decent, just like any other chocolate covered strawberry you could get from any other bakery in town there wasn't anything special about them.",0
"Review is for taste of bakery items only. We are fans of the show so me and kids had to roll in and see the Cake Boss bakery. They didn't have any fabulous cakes displayed which was a disappointment. It was a Sunday in late July so no line to complain about. The quality of pastries wasn't all that. I actually let the kids have the cookies and we opted for Bouchon bakery instead. We tried the eclair, stuffed croissant, Canoli's and cookies. If I had to wait in a line for mediocre pastures I would've been pissed.",0
"Over rated, nothing to rave about please. High prices pastry. Not worth the wait time. Disappointed! !",0
"I usually avoid this place because of the line... today it was not so bad, so I braved it... BIG MISTAKE. I stood in line behind four Italian girls, trying to figure what they wanted... another staff member asked what I would like, did 5 cookies... easy. Stood in line to pay... the Italians girls still deciding what they want. I get up to pay... Italian girls box is ready... okay fine, go ahead of me and pay... oh, no... ""can we add to order?""... ummmmm... no. Oh, but of course... I try to go ahead and pay for my box as it has been sitting on the counter... but no, I have to wait until the Italian BIMBOS decide if they want chocolate or strawberry... shove the f'ing cookies... I can tell you I have five times more money and hit Vegas twice a year... I will never be back Buddy! Plus, I will bad mouth your bakery to everyone!",0
"I love Cake boss and have been watching it since season 1 so imagine my excitement when I see Carlos bakery on the strip . I ordered a creme puff for my son. The creme inside the puff was oozing out but taste good . The puff on the other hand tasted stale. The counters weren't marked well, neither looked cared for . Looked like people who work in the store had a price tag for their smiles too",0
"We were at the Venetian for brunch and my friends, who are fans of the show (I have never seen it), wanted to stop by and check it out. I had been warned before that the line to order is always long. We waited in line for about 30 minutes or so. The staff was very friendly and everything looked amazing. I did think the prices were high though. However, I thought I would get some things to try (see if they were worth the price). I ordered an eclair ($2.50 and it was very small), 2 peanut butter cookies ($1.95 each) and an individual red velvet cake ($9.95 which is way overpriced for one small cake). In my opinion I don't think they were worth the money. With those prices I expected it to be absolutely amazing. They weren't bad, I've just had better else where at half the cost. If you don't mind waiting in the line and want to check it out do so. I just don't think I'll be back again.",0
The cannoli tasted like there was cat litter in them. So gritty and no flavor. The lemon cookie was very dry and brittle. Will not buy again.,0
"Buddy I'm calling you out on your lame cannoli. My mom can smoke you any day of the week. I can't believe you put your name on that. I'm Italian, I know Italian pastries, your shop here in vegas is a tourist trap. All hype!!! And dude, you guys break the cardinal sin of cannoli serving........you pre fill them and let them sit for hours. WTH, my man. Like any respectable host, you fill each cannoli as they are served. It takes like 6 seconds. A complete waste of $20. Shame on you my dude.",0
"I've been here twice, it's definitely overrated and customer service could use some work also. I won't be coming back. They packed my carrot cupcake in with my daughter's strawberry shortcake...not a good ideal! It was a mess by the time we made it to our room and we ended up throwing it away. I wasted $25 on absolutely nothing. Save you money and time and go to Sprinkles! It's just not worth it!",0
"The management doesn't know how to handle large crowds. They need a better work flow system. Waited 1.5 hours, got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli. I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didn't want to waste food. Truly disappointed! Not worth the wait, time, or money!",0
"This place was underwhelming and over hyped. The only pros are the staff are friendly and efficient. Despite this, lines were long and there was a long wait. I ordered a red velvet cheesecake slice. Instead, they gave me a red velvet cupcake. Everything is prepackaged so I had no idea until I got back to the hotel. It tasted AWFUL. I usually love red velvet but it was dry and the icing was extremely salty. I have never had a red velvet cupcake so gross. If you are looking for a bakery, skip this one.",0
I would love to give a higher rating but I can't. I never even got close to tasting the pastries. When I arrived they were at number 47. My number was 66. I waited 30mns and they moved up to 51. That's BS. I left disappointed. And more importantly my kids were disappointed. They are big fans of the show and they were looking forward to trying the canolis. Very disappointed. Hopefully when I actually try the pastries I will give it the higher rating it deserves.,0
"I had high expectations and I was disappointed. The pastries were super hard not moist at all and the prices are .... WTF? Won't be going again. EEk! me thinks, nope.",0
"asked what typeof coffee they served was answered with a shrug from a jerk of employee whom said ""its just coffee man"" he finally told me after several back and forwards that they serve a colombian blend. i responded by telling him if he doesnt like his job to find another job he responded by flipping my cake upside down worst part was the cake is for my 14 year old daughter who was going through a break up and was really upset he did that - management made an aloof effort by asking us to drive back to the shop a nearly impossible feat however the 1 start goes to the corporate office they were attentive and assured me that their staff should know the coffee brands and should not flip chocolate mousse cakes upside down(seemingly on purpose)",0
So disappointing. Waited in line for 20 minutes and was so excited to try this place out but it was terrible. I tried the eclair and the sprinkle cookie. The sprinkle cookie had zero flavor. The eclair had the perfect consistency of custard to pastry to chocolate but again no flavor. Definitely not with the $6.,0
Definatly NOT the best cupcakes. Very disappointed Definatly to high priced. The BEST cupcakes in this town are at PERIDOT SWEETS on Rainbow. I have had lots and lots and these are the BEST. Dont waste your time and money at the Strip.,0
"Staff and the line was quick. I bought two cream puffs, two buttercream cupcakes and a sprinkled cookie. All were very mediocre. Won't be back. They have cute souvenirs though",0
"I've been watching the show for years! So when I. Walked upon the bakery I was super stoked. Took my pictures and made my order. I spent $30 on 2 cupcakes 2 eclairs a lobster tail and a cannoli. And money is nothing for the price of some Good treats. I got back to my room and it was horrible! No flavor, the cupcakes were dry and tasted like plain cream cheese in the icing and super soggy crust in everything else. I haven't been so disappointed in a while. I wouldn't waste my money!",0
"On my daughters trip to Vegas, she brought me back a 6 pack of cupcakes. I've watched the show. I always wanted to try their cupcakes because of the way people always went ballistic on the show. Presentation was exceptional with fondant cards on top. Fondant had no taste and throw it. Pretty boxes that survived the plane ride back with no damage to presentation. With the cupcakes, I was expecting more and disappointed. 1) Vanilla cupcake w/ buttercream: cake was dry with no exceptional flavor. Buttercream was basic shortening taste and heavy. Not sweet. I've had better. 2) Chocolate cupcake w/ buttercream: cake was dry. I was at least expecting a more richer chocolate flavor. It wasn't! Buttercream tasted better with this flavor. 3) Chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting: cake was the same as above. Frosting was a real peanut butter taste. I like it sweeter. I didn't like it and throw it. I gave 3 cupcakes to a neighbor. They weren't impressed either. Overall, it's your typical italian bakery, not to sweet. Over hyped because of the show! For myself to give away cupcakes, it wasn't good.",0
"I had been to the Carol's in New York and had a great experience. My daughter really wanted to try a dessert here so I obliged. The line was INSANELY long....after about 45 minutes in line, it was finally our turn to order. The staff worked at a snail's pace but took our order nicely enough. Unfortunately, the cookies we ordered were nothing special. I think I will stick to the cannoli's and that is it.",0
"My daughter is a professional baker, and she wanted to taste their famous cannoli. She brought enough for everyone to sample. I was thinking how wonderful it would be to have a cannolo made by an old school Jersey bakery. I mean their bakery, on tv, seems to have all the classics. That nostalgia appeals to me. Buddy, seems like a nice guy. How could this possibly be a fail? Let me tell you, don't believe all the stuff you see on tv. It isn't true. It all goes back to being a kid, and your parents tell you the exact same thing! That was the flashback I had when I tasted the cannolo. The horror! The disbelief! It was all lies. Lies I tell you! These cannolis were not made by an old school baker. It was made by someone who doesn't care. They don't care that you are a fan of the show, cannoli, or anything else. I would bet that the shells are shipped to their storefront, and the filling comes in a bag, premade. Cannoli filled by someone who probably doesn't even like cannoli. Because if they did like cannoli they wouldn't put that nasty, gritty, artificial, non dairy, weird textured filling into that premade greasy shell and pass it off as authentic cannoli! Tears are streaming down my face, as I write this. Such disappointment. I will never watch that show again!",0
"We waited about 45 mins for over priced chocolate mini cakes that we extremely dry. They need more staff to help move the line along faster, only having one register open after dinner is ridiculous. Don't waste your time it money on this place.",0
I was a bit disappointed. I love the show and been waiting to travel to New Jersey to visit this place. I order the Lobster Tails and Crumb Cake. Either didn't actually move mountains for me. For the price I paid for 2 lobster tails and 1 crumb cake $20bucks seem to be very expensive and I was surprised at the flavor....didn't seem fresh....a total disappointment. The ticket system they have seems to help keep the massive crowd controlled but I have to say the wait time to order is a bit long. Hopefully things are better at the actual venue in New Jersey. Gonna give them one more chance. Still love the tv show though.,0
"Do not go to this place unless you are ready to be disappointed. Me and my husband came to this place in hopes that I would find a sfogliatella. Normally they are a very very nice size as being a brooklynite I was expecting the nice size. What I got wasn't even the size of my hand. It was small extremely stale. They didn't even bother to put powdered sugar on the pastry. I was sooo upset that I spent that money on it. Next the lines aren't bad but the disorganization is a joke, we had been waiting for our order for about 15 minutes and our order was two sfogliatella and two canolli. Which by the way was also horrible.... not what I had expected from a place like this because he's world famous. Fix your business buddie it's really horrible. I will never step a foot back in this place, sad but true.",0
Absolutely no line in the evening on a week day. The pastries underwhelmed us. Just not our style. Fun to visit as big fans of the show.,0
"The strawberry shortcake was delicious. The customer service was awful! I waited in line for over ten minutes before reaching the counter and was promptly ignored by the cashier when attempting to pick up my online order. When I finally got sick of waiting and handed her my confirmation for my order, she didn't even say a word, just handed off the paper to another employee! Though we enjoyed the cake, we will not be back! The staff didn't even offer a greeting to any of their customers upon walking in or wish them well when they were leaving.",0
"I was so excited to taste a piece of the rainbow cake with sprinkles topping, I paid $10 for a small slice. The cake looks beautiful unfortunately the taste of the cake was exceptional disappointing. Sad when a famous chef fails to deliver a quality product.",0
"We went this past weekend, is the third time we tried the pastries and every time the quality of the products is getting worse! The cannolis were ok, the cream taste old. The lobster tails were soooo old and hard you can't even get a bite. So sad that a place like this is taking advantage of its fame to sell",0
Long lines. Slow service. Overpriced. Not impressed with pastries taste& presentation. Packaging is cute but unnecessary and time consuming. Do not order a latte unless you want to add extra 10 mins to your already long wait (cashier makes ur coffee). Employees have zero sense of urgency.,0
First of all they shouldn't have kids working there second the lines are so long.i know buddy wouldn't like the quality of the pastries his workers are putting out the pastries look like crap and way over priced.plz fix the lobster tail.,0
I can't say how totally disappointed I was in going to the Vegas location of Carlo's Bakery!! I don't gamble and I'm not into Blue a man Group so for me Vegas is visiting family and getting good grub. I love lobster tails and I'm not talking the fishy kind I'm talking the amazing east coast confection that is slightly crisp on the outside but soft and gooey and filled with a delicious custard.. unfortunately that's not what I got at Carlo's.!! I wished I'd have tasted one before I bought 7 of them to take home to friends.. well I couldn't wait so on the car ride home to AZ I dug in and wished I'd had a trash can to spit it back out.. it was awful hard beyond belief with hardly any filling and tasted so badly of old grease that I could only take that one bite.. I had my husband try another one hoping it was just the one and he couldn't take but one bite either.. the whole batch tasted like four day old leftovers yet we had only gotten them an hour before and we specifically got to the bakery early to get the freshest ones. Well I think we got the oldest ones they had.. not going to go back here maybe when we visit friends in Jersey we will try the original shop.. sorry Buddy this place was terrible!!,0
"They got my order wrong. I told three people, the strawberry shortcake NOT the chocolate strawberry. I pointed at it, told them explicitly not the chocolate and at the register she said chocolate and I said, ""no I told two people not the chocolate!"" Charged me for the vanilla I wanted, I opened the box and what do you know, it was chocolate. Mind you, the vanilla/strawberry thing was the only thing not labeled and I assumed it was strawberry shortcake but apparently wasn't exactly what it was called and that's what got everybody confused and it turns out it was what it's called but I'm not the one who didn't label it. So they got my order wrong, and the Oreo and the chocolate/strawberry tower I got wasn't even that good. The vanilla cupcake wasn't any better. The buttercream tasted like buttercream from albertsons cupcakes. And mind you, this isn't a bad review just because they got my order wrong and I'm salty about it. I was hoping the cake and pastries would make up for it and they sadly didn't. You pay for the name and that's it. Sprinkles has WAY better cupcakes. Which is where I went after to soothe my pain of a terrible cupcake I spent 6 dollars on, I got a 1000% better one for half the price.",0
"Very disappointing, got the fabled Cannoli's and what an absolute waste of money. I had actually gotten some from a different bakery at Paris and assumed that as well as those tasted, Carlos's would be better, boy was I wrong! Buddy needs to stick to making cakes that look good, and I'm sure don't taste good.",0
I came here because of Cake Boss & knew for sure I had to try the lobster tails. It's definitely a popular place but the wait is not too long. Grab and number and take a look around. There's a big glass so you can see the workers working in the inside. Seats are limited so grab them quick. In the end I got a Lobster Tail & a Mini Cannoli. I'd say skip this place. The pastries were nothing special...I actually wish I had stuck to one pastry after seeing the quality of the goods.,0
Rude female employee asked her a question she spoke to me like I am not intelligent and as I was talking she turned her back on me and walked away.,0
"So disappointing!!! Love Cake Boss and was excited to try some pastries. We tried a few different items. The seven layer cookie (I know them as rainbow cookies in NY) was very average. Tried a pecan snowball cookie. So dry!!!! And so bland. Hubs and I each got beautiful sugar cookies with sprinkles. They looked great! Once again, bland!!! Zero flavor. With so many options in Vegas, you are better off going elsewhere for sweets. The only good thing...their prices are not bad, especially for Vegas!",0
"I was very excited to try this place but it was not like I expected it to be. Seeing the long line I thought it would taste great, but once I entered the location, the bakery items looked very average. I knew by its appearance that desserts would not be what the hype was about but I really wanted to give it a try telling myself that something has to be great with everyone sanding in line for a treat. I ordered the most popular thing on their shelf and let me tell you, it was most definitely not good at all. I ordered 2 lobster tails, 1 strawberry shortcake and 1 chocolate hazelnut cupcake - $27 later I am left unpleasantly dissatisfied. One plus was the very helpful clerk behind the counter.",0
"It's a huge rip off! And to top it off the cashier was totally unfair! There was a special being offered where if you buy $24.95, you get an apron. We bought about $65 worth and she didn't want to split the check between me and my mother in law so we could get 2 aprons even though we both paid for it! But she had just done it to a customer ahead of us!!!!!",0
"Well since my last review got deleted, I will try this again. The staff is very friendly the desserts are tasty but not worth the money that you spend. You're basically paying for the name of Cake Boss. If you just went to say you had a treat from the Cake Boss guy then by all means spend your money. They charged my wife for the wrong item and the cannoli that my kids got did not taste better than anything I would have found from any other pastry store for 1/3 the price.",0
"Very disappointing. We purchased a cannoli, caramel cupcake and cheesecake with chocolate mouse and and a chocolate covered strawberry on top. Cannoli was very good and tasted like a cannoli should! The caramel cupcake was so dense, dry and completely flavorless. The icing was hard and crushed the cake when we tried to cut into it with a fork. I love cupcakes and enjoy more light and fluffy icing with a moist cake. The cheesecake bottom was good. A rich cream taste and very smooth, the chocolate mouse was light and airy and had a good taste but something about the taste of the chocolate on the strawberries gave it a foul taste, like spoiled milk. We threw it and the cupcake away. So basically we enjoyed a 20.00 cannoli. I'd save my money and go elsewhere.",0
"I was so disappointed with this bakery. All they have is brownie, cupcakes, biscottis and a few cannolis. A piece of brownie is $10??? Jean-Philippe is so much better!",0
Went here excited thinking sweets would be some of the best and wow were we wrong. This place is super over priced the Cannoli's weren't good. I got enough for my whole family and no one liked them. Won't be going back to this place not worth it at all.,0
"Extremely expensive items, too much & heavy frosting, sugar overload, no balance. I would give half a star if I could.",0
"Waaaaayyyy overrated! Extremely disappointed. My girls and I were huge Cake boss fans so Carlos was a must visit on our trip to Vegas. Line wasn't too bad but the whole ordering, check out process was so inefficient. You pick out what you want then have to wait for one person to box it up. I had to try his famous red velvet cupcake. Nothing special and the frosting desperately needed more sugar. It tasted like plain cream cheese. My daughter had lobster tail....loaded with way too much filling to make it enjoyable. My other daughter had a mini cheesecake which was overly sweet. I'm not one to write bad reviews....this is a first for me....I'm miffed we wasted time and money for such mediocre baked goods.",0
Is to expensive $34.55 for 1 cheesecake 1 chocolate mouse mini cake i canolli and 1 strawberry last year the flavor was diferent never back again!!!,0
"Yeah,I'm going to have to agree with everyone that this place is all hype...only good thing was that I didn't have to wait in line..the first time I tried it was more than an hour wait so I left...",0
"We were going to make time between shows, dining, walking the strip, sight seeing & relaxing at our beautiful hotel to visit & buy several treats from Carlo's Bakery. There wasn't any room for discussion, it was a must see! After watching the show for year's, recording the shows with DVR & sometimes watching repeats of repeats, we were so excited. We wound our way through the beautiful hotel & casino arriving at the famously decorated Carlo's Bakery to be greeted by a very long line. Everyone was smiling, conversations were loud & picture's were snapping right & left. We watched the bakers busy in the kitchen through the flawlessly polished window. We shared stories with the family in front of us, who were visiting Carlo's Bakery from the mid-west for the same reasons & honestly it was somewhat fun waiting in line. When we were at the front of the line, we had our eye's peeled on each & every dessert we wanted to taste. They loaded our boxes, we paid a pretty penny & more than we would normally pay at even the best bakeries in the Los Angeles area, but we had dreamed of this day & we wanted to sink our teeth into several of Carlo's treats. We walked away with great anticipation carrying our boxes with joy. When we finally sat down to share our treats we examined the smells & textures for a minute & then we began tasting. ""What?"" ""What is this?"" ""This must be a bad batch, how do you like yours so far?"" ""Ugh, I don't like it, it tastes terrible, the pastry is rubbery, the cream is not creamy, it is stiff!"" ""Let's try something else!"" So one by one, we tasted each treat & to our dismay, we found only one that tasted very good. We loved the sprinkle cookie, but it honestly tasted like many other very good sprinkle cookies. In closing, it was fun, the bakery was beautiful with a fun look, but we would not go again. Only 1 of 7 different treats tasted good & we we heart broken.",0
"Super disappointed in this bakery!! Was here last night waiting in a 30 minute+ line with 2 kids only to be told when ordering that there were no more cannolis left. Okay so it was 630 pm, I get it! You're only well known for these things but whatever. I asked the cashier after buying some cookies since we were waiting so long when he recommends coming back for them and he said...8 am is the best time when we open. So here we are at 8 am only to be told that ""today they are only serving it in evening!"" Three things: 1) let people know when they are waiting in line when something is out... 2) train your staff on being accurate and truthful on your bakery and when things are available 3) really? No cannolis in your bakery but available online... I'll pass!",0
Well I didn't go but I am sure the food is good. I was not going to wait over an hour in line to be rushed through. If I had known I would not have wasted my time going. Very disappointed.,0
I ordered the vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing. The cake was tough and not fresh. The buttercream had almost no taste. It was the worst cupcake I've ever had. It was an absolute disappointment.,0
"Every time we've gone to Vegas, there has been a 30-60 minute wait to get in, so I always pass by. I was thrilled when I saw there was no line one day. I bought a yellow cupcake with chocolate frosting. The cupcake was dry and void of flavor. The frosting tasted as if it were made from Crisco. I threw most of it away and won't go back.",0
"I went here whilst staying at The Venetian hotel over New Year's Eve and honestly had a terrible experience. I was very excited to visit the bakery as I used to watch cake boss on TV and absolutely LOVED the show. I tried the lobster tail which is highly overrated, the cupcakes which were dry and a few other pastries that aren't even worth mentioning as I don't even remember anymore they left no impression on me. Definitely does not deserve to have its own tv show- there are much better bakeries out there.",0
"Why do we have to give a star? As a longtime fan of the show my expectations were pretty high, but sadly completely let down. I had called earlier that day to see if they had the coffee crumb cake and if they could set it aside for me. The girl said yes and when I arrived I was told they didn't have it and there was non in the shop. I told them the situation and they said oh well. So I called my family to see what else they'd want me to grab since they didn't save the coffee Cake. The girl who was helping me had a lot of attitude with me after that and they began snickering with other workers whenever I would ask for something else and then they would say it was out. My experience here was horrible mainly due to customer service and made me not want to even purchase the items... then to top it off I got into the car and tried one of the cannolis. I've had better cannolis at lascaris. So disappointed in the service and pastries...",0
I'm disappointed... Cupcakes and cheesecake were awful!!! Not worth waiting in a long line!,0
"Don't get the cupcakes. Had high expectations given all the hype, but the cupcakes were dry, stale, and hard around the edges. There was ample icing, probably in an attempt to hide the stale cake, but beyond being just sweet had no flavor at all. I didn't get anything else and based on the lack of quality control I won't be going back.",0
"Why did I wait in line for this place? The donuts, cookies, and pastries were so bland. Everything looked so tempting in the display case too. I can see why it takes forever too...they first put the items on a tray and then transfer them to a box/bag. Then it all goes to a cashier who goes over your order again. Seems so inefficient. Instead, go to Bouchon Bakery or Paris Baguette, where you can taste delicious baked goods!!",0
"Wonderful artificial taste and texture. Looks are deceiving - the chocolate cookie was hard, the chocolate cupcake with cream frosting was fake tasting and describing the frosting as a cream frosting seems inaccurate. Go elsewhere if you want REAL sweet treats made with real ingredients.",0
"My family and I were so trill to see the cake boss bakery in Las Vegas until we had their pasties . My sis and I had the cannoli, the cream tasted grainy and chalky and of course they were soggy. My husband had the napoleon the custard was pure corn starch, it needed vanilla flavor or milk or something! My niece had the cheesecake and that was actually good, because of the cheesecake I'm giving them one star. Changes are I will never come back again.",0
"Honestly, I'm a fan of the next great baker! And I've been wanting to try Carlo's Bakery for the longest.. So today it finally happened and I don't understand what the hype is. On the show, Buddy was very big on the importance of the ""sponge"" in a cake/cupcake. It should be moist, soft, and delightful. Me, my mom, my brother, and his girlfriend all bought one and tried it together and both cupcakes, the red velvet and the carrot cake, were dry! We tried a Canoli which was good and the Lobster tail was good as well but nothing was ""amazing"". The service was good but the desserts were a disappointment. Not to mention the desserts were pretty pricey so yea I'm not coming back.",0
"More worker does not equal faster service. This place needs to hire some workers that know what they're doing. It should not take 30 mins to package a few canollis and some cupcakes. I had to wait 40 mins in line and 20 mins for my order to be packaged, but the workers accidentally smashed a few things so it took another 10mins for them to figure their shit out. I ended up canceling half of my order because it took so goddamn long. It's very off putting when you've been waiting for a very long time only to see the workers just standing around, talking to each other, and slowly putting your order together. The desserts are mediocre but the lobster tail is pretty bomb. Totally not worth the wait though.",0
I have to say I was VERY excited to come here I had such high expectations. First we get there and the line is pretty long which I had no problem waiting but waiting because the employees just have no system going. It was chaos no one was directing customers so the line was at a standstill. After waiting 25min we order and wait another 10 min for them to ring is up. Then finally get back to the room to indulge in our treats and what a LET DOWN!!! I'm not saying it was bad but by no means did it live up to the hype and not worth the wait. I wouldn't go back.,0
"The amount of options were really low, costumer service wasn't that great and the fact that you can't eat your bake goods on a table and enjoy it. I'm just disappointed with all the hype for nothing.",0
"I grew up in NYC, the home of the best Italian pasty shops in the world. It is the only thing I miss about NYC. I was very excited when I read that Carlo's was opening here in Las Vegas. I, like many others, watched the tv show and enjoyed it. I was sure I was finally going to get authentic Italian pastry right here in my town. The first time we attempted to buy some pastries the line was out the door and we gave up. We went again last week and were successful. One of my favorite pastries is sfogiliatella. I bought four. I was in heaven. When I got home I attacked my first one. It was horrible. It was DRY, DRY. Such a disappointment. My husband tried the second and he agreed. I wound up just throwing the other two away. I'm soooooooo disappointed.",0
"We had a cannoli, a mini mouse cake and a nut brownie. They were okay, nothing fantastic. I can make better at home with box mix. The brownie was dry and was more cake like. It was expensive and I don't think it was worth it. There were other bakeries in the Venetian that looked really good. I would recommend trying one of them.",0
I will still come to Jersey to try the real thing but this place is a huge swing and a miss! Buddy if you're going to branch out get on top of this place quick. Take more time on getting the taste down and not working about presenting it in a perfect box.,0
"This place is located on the second floor of the mall that connects the palazzo and the venetian. OK seriously this is the most overrated and overpriced dessert house i have ever been to. OK its the strip I should have been more aware,but when you order 6 pastries and it comes to 68 dollars it better be the best fing pastry you have ever tasted. taste was average at best. But the boxes and string were first rate,i suspect thats what i was paying for. just another example of an all hyped out fancy schmancy underwhelming and thoroughly disappointing experience on the strip. Why is it that all these places on the strip put so much into the visual experience and short people on the tatse experience,these are places to eat not places to look at views...smh",0
Wish I could give zero stars. What I will add is the huge lack of respect the owner must have for their own customers. I waited in line 25 minutes. And then another 30 minutes to get my stuff. Should of done what several people did- leave! Feel bad for the tourist who are wasting their precious time in Vegas to buy the crap they are selling here. Hire more employees to pack orders. Although this might be intentional to make people think they are more popular than they are. If you have a car - go to Bagel Cafe. GPS it. Much of what you buy at Carlos can be found here. Many times better & for less money.,0
"My mom was in town visiting and LOVES the show Cake Boss so we decided to stop by the shop... boy were we disappointed. There was no line but we found a very limited selection (earlier in the day), it was a very small space and the girl behind the register could not answer any of my mothers questions (i.e.- will more product be made and put out for purchase, what time do you close tonight, etc. really?). We decided not to buy anything and make it a short visit due to the experience, not to mention the ridiculous prices! Yikes, needs some work to make things better for sure!",0
Disappointed. Got there at 8 so I wouldn't have a long wait. They opened 20 minutes late and I only went there for a cannoli and cheese cake and they didn't even have any.,0
"I ain't gonna lie, I had high hopes...but was let down! I saw the long line and thought oh this must be good! Not so much...it was just average, not sure if the quality was lost in the transfer to Las Vegas. When I go to New Jersey, I'll have to try the original. But for now the Las Vegas spot missed the mark. Then you add in the high prices they charge, and ouch that makes it hurt worse! :(",0
"Pricey and wasn't worth the wait. The cookie bag was $22 -.-"" quite pricey for 1lb. The mini cakes was $10.",0
"After spending $145 on a fondant cake that I probably could've got 1/2 the price at another bakery and been more satisfied, I'm writing this review in hopes that they will fix whatever is going on down there. Not only is the staff unprofessional but they are clearly uneducated. I called in 4 different times to speak with someone on when the cake would be ready and also to make sure the special instructions were received ( when you order online it doesn't allow you to type more than 7-8 characters, good luck with that). After finally getting through to someone he had to ask my name 3 different times and placed me on hold that many as well to go see the status of the cake. I paid extra to have the lemon and raspberry filling which was good, I wouldn't go above that. I'm giving this 2 stars because when your dealing with a business of this caliber you expect a little more greatness. The day of picking the cake up I had to wait 35 mins with another gentleman just to get my cake. That just seems unethical. I don't know if it's because they are understaffed or just the crowd situation due to poor planning of having guest wait in line. I really hope more detail is payed attention to here in the future. I definitely won't be ordering anymore birthday cakes from here for a while. In my pictures you'll see flour all over the fondant and cake from putting the bow on. Also the icing layer to stick the fondant on the cake was so thick it took over the filling flavor and left you with a sweet piece of cake that you didn't want to finish. We ended up just eating the center and throwing out the rest. Buddy please visit this store and fix what is going on!!!!",0
"Well I watched every episode of cake boss and thought wow how it looked amazing and how I would so like to try . I'm Vegas and my daughter and I hear he opened one in Vegas and we're thrilled and couldn't wait to try. However, we buy and can't wait to get back to hotel to partake and to our disappointment the cupcakes all two n cake we purchased were not good at all. They were dry n cream wasn't soft n creamy n I don't bake , but box mix would have tasted better :/ . So will not be going their again sorry",0
"We waited in line for almost 30 minutes. There is a window to watch the bakers in the back. That kitchen was filthy! You pick what you want at the counter. Nothing has descriptions or prices on it. We ended up getting a mini $10 cheesecake, a $7 carrot cake cupcake, and other ridiculously priced items. The carrot cake was dry and bland. The cheesecake was ok but not with $10. The lobster tail was hard and crunchy. I would never come back. It's only popular because of the Tv show, but their baked goods are not worth it.",0
This is so annoying !!!!!!!!!!!!! I waited in line for 25 mins for chocolate covered strawberries for their not to be any! Not to mention I was stared at by staff for over 10 mins while they fulfill everyone else's order and cut some fucking tape and completely ignore me. This is beyond rude and completely stupid. The manger even came out to see her so hard working staff be complete idiots. There is no sense of customer service what so ever. Thanks for nothing carlos bakery. I'm headed to Godiva.,0
Spent $18 on 2 dry tasteless cookies and 2 Brownies that we're dry and old- very disappointing! Don't waste your $$,0
"I have always wanted a birthday cake from the famous carlos bakery. We moved her just before my 40th bday. I was so excited, I told my mom and husband that is the cake i wanted, a carlos bakery cake. I showed him a picture from a visit before that I wanted. He got me the beach cake. I was so excited. When he got home, half the top of the decorations had slid off the top and down the side. It looked horrible and my husband felt horrible. But who cares, lets dive into to the yummy cake. Not!! The fondant peeled off the cake rather than through it when cut. Tasted nasty and plain and hard. The cake was barely tasteful to eat. Never saw 1 part of the rave of carlos bakery cakes I have heard about forever. We didn't even want to finish it, we threw half of it away. I would have rather had a $10 cake from the store rather than this nasty little runny cake for $50. I never want a cake or anything from carlos again.",0
"This place is a waste of time. You wait in line for over an hour. Granted I understand their method of a conventional style bakery. But to that fact maybe you should include on your website, the fact not all of your desserts are ""served daily"". Very disappointed and feel that they should fix situations like this instead of the usual ""sorry"" and smile.",0
"If you don't mind standing in line for an hour because of lack of organization and then eating subpar bake goods, this place is for you.",0
"This place is horrible! I'm a fan of Cake Boss and the Next Great Baker. I had dessert reservations at another place but decided to cancel once I found out there was a Carlo's here. I was excited to try it. I get there and of course there is a bit of a wait but that is understandable. I will say the people packing up the orders were a tad slow but ok no big deal. I ordered cannoli's, cookies, carrot cake and crumb cake. 100% disgusting. The cannoli filling didn't taste like anything and it was kind of hard. The cookies were hard as bricks. The carrot cake tasted like a block of cream cheese with a little spice mixed in. The crumb cake was hard as a brick as well. I wasted my money on this place. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!",0
"If you like - Sugar, Sugar, Sugar and Slow as Molasses out of the Freezer! Then you will like Carlo's! My husband and I finally on the third try during our stay in Las Vegas got to order at Carlo's and I have to say, if you like sugar then you will like Carlo's but it is NOT worth the wait! We actually took a number went to lunch at Soago, walked back and still had three people in front of us! 1 hour and 40 minute wait for a bakery? The butter cookies ($16.95/pound) were good, the biscotti ($22.50/pound) average (had much better at Pizzeria Mozza to Go in West Hollywood) and the lobster tail ($5.95) - croissant-like dessert with cream-frosting filling - tasty (probably 800 -1,000 calories). The carrot cake cupcake ($3.50), pretty to look at just a but dry - skip the cupcakes. Maybe try the frosting covered brownie??? The best was the triple-chocolate meringue ($3.50) - melted in your mouth! Anyway, grab a # go for a walk 1/2 and come back with coffee and a good book. The usual wait time us 30-75 minutes. BTW - once you get waited on, the servers could not be more helpful and polite!",0
"What is the hype about this place? Only reason I'm giving them two stars and not one is because of their chocolate cannoli. I got one of their coffee cakes and it was just disgusting. Threw it away right away. It was a big piece of rock, just old and stale. Not worth a 15 min wait.",0
"While the lobster tails were very good, cannolis not so much. Rugelach was good,but OMG pricy. Like 23 or 24 dollars a pound. Here is my big complaint. I spent about $24.00 but then I was charged over $2.00 tax. I was PO'ed. I promptly phoned Carlo's and the gal who answered told me they charge tax on everything. I asked who the manager was and I was told TINA. I left my name and number and asked if Tina would return my call. This was 6 weeks ago and I am still waiting. Well I am so angry I had phoned the franchise tax board who confirmed that I should not have been charged sales tax. Here is this tremendous business who is overcharging customers over 8% on every single purchase. The only item they could charge tax on is a beverage or a pastry eaten at their counter. Another example of the tax scam is go to Sprinkles at the Linqs. If I order 4 cupcakes no tax. For all the people who say they watched Buddy on Foodnetwork, they don't know what they are talking about. His show was on TLC.",0
"I finally decide to check Carlo Bakery and surprise my hubby with some delicious pastry. On the and I just surprise myself paying $32 for two chocolate mouse cakes, one doughnuts, one cookie and one cupcake . $32????? Ok , I was thinking maybe because is so damn expensive is heavenly delicious . I was almost crying after we try doughnuts and mouse cake. Doughnuts was filled with cannelloni cream and aftertaste was very bad, I felt flour in my mouth. Mouse cake also was dry, not fresh at all. I am glad I try but I am definitely not going back. Vegas have much more and much better bakery's all around town and even we can by better cakes in our grocery store",0
disappointed after hearing such good things about this place. It's pretty pricy for something that wasn't good. Def wouldn't go back. And the person that helped me seemed a little annoyed because I placed a big order and she kept having to go back and fourth,0
"I don't know much about the show but I'm sure the guy is great and successful. My Aunt has been to the original bakery since the 90s and has said good things. This place needs to get their act together. There is one line to wait on to pick out what you would like. When you get up to the counter and someone helps you there are no descriptions, no prices for 90% of the items. I know this is going to be expensive because it's on the strip so I go ahead and get some things - black and white cookies, canoli, cream puffs, chocolate chip cookies and a 3-layer cookie - which is my favorite and a holiday tradition for me. I was very excited for this 3 layer cookie to compare it to my own. The employee puts everything on a tray, asks my name and tells me to wait in another line to pay and get my baked goods. ANOTHER LINE. I see them place things in boxes and wrap them up the NY way in red and white string which is great but I'm not getting 2 dozen italian cookies and I could for-go the boxing because I was handing out the treats to my family in 10 minutes. So we wait and wait and wait some more, around 20 minutes to pay. The poor cashier needs to go to a line of waiting orders, type in everything the person ordered and ring them up, then call the person's name - which is horrible inefficient. Overall, it took probably 40minutes from standing in line to finish and they forgot my 3 layer cookie which cost a fortune. Never, ever go there. Save yourself for a true italian bakery in NY. This place is waste of time and money.",0
My wife and tried this place today and came out not impressed. We got a cannoli and pumpkin cheesecake. First off i think jack in the box has better cheesecake. And her cannoli was not good at all. And having been to the shop in new jersey i can say the flavors are not the same at both shops.,0
Not so good. Both my wife and I got something g here and we both are half and threw the rest out. My raspberry tart was bland and very dry. It was the worst tart I ever had. I do t like giving bad reviews but I feel like they are putting no effort into their product just because it's Vegas,0
"Let's just say my grandmothers and moms baking is WAY better than this. It's overrated and blehhh. Definitely not worth the wait or the price. Go to your local mexican panaderia and I promise you'll spend less time, less money and say ""YUM! Que bueno!"" more times than this ....whatever they call it..""fancy cakes."" I wish Buddy did something about those employees, they have absolutely no sense of urgency when it comes to service. ANDALE! you have people waiting mensos!!",0
I would agree with the other reviewers. 1. over rated 2. over priced 3. average baked goods my theory is that they are slow and the long lines are intentional to create a buzz that there is something great here and worth the wait. anytime people see a long line they naturally are inclined to think the food must be fabulous. the reality is they have 1 cashier and 1 girl taking your order. like many things in vegas this just another celebrity gimmick slapping their name on an establishment.,0
"Went there today for the first time and as we were waiting in line we saw one of the workers named shanel, eating with gloves on. Then she started to scratch her face, her arms, and her back and never bothered to change her gloves. Then she started to prep some of the pastries. I ended up buying a cannoli which was really good, but that one employee was just very disgusting. And I have this place 1 star because of her.",0
"I was very disappointed with the experience I thought it would be better considering he's so famous and he goes around to other bakeries and tells them how to bake! I love the show and was so excited about going to the bakery and then it just was a huge letdown! The cupcakes we're not that great I got a red velvet cupcake the ratio of frosting to cupcake was not good also got a carrot cake cupcake it was ok don't get me wrong they look beautiful they just don't taste as good as they look.... My daughter got a Boston cream pie it looks like something you would get at a hospital did not taste good and was really small and cost $8! The only thing I can say good about the place was the lobster tails were pretty good and the cannolis were okay... The prices were way too expensive. You would think considering he is at the Venetian hotel that there would be a shop to actually do shopping in but there's not the bakery is tiny and there's nowhere to actually get souvenirs, and because the bakery is so small you feel rushed, not only that you can't even tell where the line starts and were the bakery actually is in the hotel! I seriously would not waste my time with this shop not worth it! Customer service isn't that great huge lack of communication! I have been a huge fan of buddies from the start but now I don't know what to think! I'm really grateful that I didn't waste the money to have the cannolis shipped to my house totally not worth it! If you're in Vegas and the line is huge honestly I wouldn't even waste the time its not worth it! Just disappointed! I seriously feel like even if I was in New Jersey on vacation I would not even stop at his shop now because of this.... I hope that maybe in a few more months his bakery will get better maybe it's just because it just opened who knows not even sure if I'll ever give it another shot though but we'll see....",0
"Very disappointing. We ordered 6 cupcakes , the icing is horrible . Took them home to my kids because they are huge fans of the cake boss and we were very disappointed.",0
"THE CANOLI cream tastes like eating white flour .... Not worth the hype, the red velvet cup cake is meh ... Sorry Carlos",0
"In the past it was amazing. However today was not the case. Brownies were dry, strawberry shortcake was disgusting. Kitchen was dirty",0
"Awful experience. Guest specialist Alyssa had a horrible attitude. She should be fired. The cashier Akberet, however, was very polite. Thumbs down for bad service!",0
"Total disappointment!! Expensive, stale and a long wait. Don't waste your time and money!!",0
"After willing to try this place for a long time, I finally tried it, and decided that the long line wasn't really worth it at all. First of all, the food and customer service looked like a big joke. I ordered a crumb cake and a lobster tail which both looked dry. Second of all, the lack of organization in the tiny shop was ridiculous. The people behind me were paying in first and I was left for last. That immediately struck me as horrible customer service. But, it doesn't end there. When I got home I tried cutting the crumb cake, and it was stiff as a hockey puck. It just looked really old, and dry as I expected. Lastly, the lobster tail was soggy, mushy, and flavorless. In the end, I've saw Cake Boss and I expected that their pastries were going to be decadent and delicious, but it was not close to that. Try it at your own risk.",0
Ive been a fan of The Cake Boss for years and I could not wait to go to his bakery in Vegas. Omg!! What a let down. The prices are over the top for the quality. The lobster tail was good but it was half the size of other bakeries and double the price but it is Vegas after all. The cases were half empty and it was about noon. The cases should've been full. The staff was less than enthusiastic to say the least. The cream puffs and eclairs looked terrible. Like they were just thrown together. I worked at a bakery in a grocery store for years and they made better cream puffs and eclairs than at Carlos' Bakery. It was a huge disappointment. I expected top notch product and service. They do keep the line moving quickly though. That's the only good thing.,0
"Typical tourist trap. We waited in line 20 minutes for a small cannoli and two black coffees. The problem was not the length of the line, it was the fact that the 25 people working there are the slowest most inefficient people I have ever seen work. I was maybe the third person in line and it still took that long! The coffee was disgusting and bitter. The cannoli was good but not at all worth the wait.",0
"Don't give into the hype. I love buddy but after visiting his shop I was very disappointed. Everything looks very pretty but there is no flavor to any of it. I got the lobster tail, cannoli, orea cake thing, a cupcake.. All flavorless. :( I HIGHLY recommend going to Freed's if you're actually looking for great pastries and not just to visit a place that's on TV.",0
How on earth do you have 40 customers waiting for service and 2 people attending the counter!!! I counted 12 employees and they were too busy getting ready to close to attend customers! I guess once you are famous why care about your fans or customers. Don't bother waiting!,0
This place sucks! Don't go here. The Sfogliatelle are horrible and the rest is substandard! The staff was extremely non accommodating to our simple request to add maraschino cherries to the ends if our sons overly sweetened cannoli!,0
"As a frequent guest at the Venetian/Palazzo, we always try to squeeze in a stop to Carlos Bakery for a Lobster Tail and coffee. While all of the pastries/desserts look so deliciously tempting, the Lobster Tail is our favorite, ever since we first had it on an NCL cruise I must say that I find a surprising lack of good, friendly service at this Grand Canal Shops location. We usually go there mid-morning after the early morning rush is done. While the counter attendants are quick to serve us, it seems as though they are just going thru the motions and can't wait to return to their chatting with their behind-the-counter coworkers. We always order coffees and ask for cream - I don't understand why there's no cream or half & half at the sugar/mixing counter like their competition? Or, at least have those small disposable containers of cream available at the register. They keep the cream in a fridge under the coffee brewer, and even if I request to pour my own cream, they always insist on pouring it behind the counter. Everyone has their own preference as to how much cream they want - these servers either pour way too much or not enough and we always need to ask for a coffee redo or more cream. The workers then react as if I'm the one that messed up the coffee in the first place or as if I'm asking for too much. On our last visit 11/28/17, when I asked for more cream, the guy told me that they ran out. ????? Too bad, we love the products, but in Vegas there's many other options.",0
I was super excited to try the pastries here but I was so disappointed. The pastries look ok and taste like the typical grocery store pastries. I was hoping to try new flavors. Nothing special just waste of money! Won't ever go back!,0
"Friendly staff! Great lobster tails! ""No cannolis for the weekend""..... Today is monday and still no cannolis were avaliable :( I was very disappointed, Nothing like the actual bakery you see in the T.V show on TLC. I will not be returning back, a huge disappointment. Especially when I saw regular bread on display that you can buy at any local bakery at least here in california. I expected so much from buddy's bakery. I am a huge fan but truly not a 5 star rating place.",0
"DON'T buy your wedding cake here!! I ordered a cake here from Elizabeth, the manager. She was very nice. I text her a picture of the cake. A ""naked"" cake. No flowers, no fondant, very little icing. I wanted 4 layers for 150 people. Yellow cake with Bailey cream filling with fresh berries filling. She showed me the cake on display and said it would be that size. I asked the price and she quoted me $650. I said OK. I asked about delivery. My venue was 2.7 miles away from the bakery. She said they did not have a delivery truck but that the cake would have to be assembled at the venue. So she decided that someone would indeed have to deliver and assemble it. I asked what the charge would be and she said about $50. I agreed to that charge and said if it was more to give me a call. I offered to pay in full but she said that would not be necessary. I left assuming my order was set. She never called me back so I assumed that there was no problem. A WEEK before the wedding I called to give them my credit card number and long story short, Elizabeth now says the price for the cake is now $1,200 !!!!! With a $200 delivery charge, because one of their employees would have to use their own vehicle. She said it was a very complex cake and that it required all kinds of complex construction. She said she had called the office in Hoboken and they said that's what the charge is. I said I would have to think about that since they had almost doubled the price AFTER I placed my order and had no time to shop for another cake. I emailed the Hoboken bakery and they said they had forwarded my email to the Las Vegas bakery and that I would receive a call from them within 48 hours. No one ever called. So less than a week from the wedding I had to shop for a wedding cake again. Fortunately the Monte Carlo Hotel came to my rescue and made the same cake, but bigger for $650 and delivered it free. Guess Carlos Bakery is such a big name that they don't care about my business or their reputation as a new bakery in this town. Very, very disappointed.",0
"Incredibly disappointing experience. Boyfriend and I are big fans of Cake Boss, so of course we wanted to come here. The line was over an hour long, and the prices are ridiculous. The actual pastries are sooo overrated. Sweet and flaky, yes, but just okay. There are so many other places on the strip that have amazing desserts, and this isn't one of them. Don't fall into the hype.",0
"I used to love the show, and Buddy is always talking about doing a great customer service... well... that's exactly the opposite of what I got... many employees - but not being able to handle customers, when I was asked for my name, I spelled it - (an Italian name on a Italian owned business), and the employee changed my name on purpose, joking that it would be easier to say - when I said I would consider that offensive... she laughed on me. I was about to explode at that time, when she called me wrong again, and when I literally asked ""what the heck is wrong with you"", she started to say ""I'm sorry - in between laughs"". In the end... I really didn't like the canoli - one of my very favorites pastries... too heavy... the lobster tail is very decent... will return? Absolutely not... not even when in Hoboken... VERY disappointed. Watching the man give other owners words of wisdom on how to improve their business, he could use some of those words on his own business. By the way... he was inside - talking to employees and not even a smile to the crowd outside... I think friendliness is just for TV.",0
"Unfortunately after having Jean Phillipe Patisserie , Carlo's didn't seem as good. Tried the lobster tail and cream puff from their place. Lobster tail was stuffed with cream which was really good but i found the puff pasty to be harder than normal and chewy. Puff pastry was really disappointment as I have had better one in regular cheap bakery shops.. Maybe other stuff are good which I didn't get to try.",0
No famous lobster tails for a WEEK?! Super disappointing. I imagine they are in for a rough week considering everyone that walks in specifically asks for the lobster tails.,0
"I hate to say it because I'm a big fan of the Cake Boss show but I was pretty disappointed. I had a cannoli and it just tasted burnt and way to heavy and sweet. Also, there was a very long line that moved super slow. Perhaps some other desserts are better but I would not waste time trying this place again.",0
"Growing up watching buddy's shows I was expecting the lobster tail and cream puffs to be tasty. Instead they tasted old, I could smell the eggs in the cream!!! It was very nasty. I took one bite and threw them both in the trash. Buddy really disappointed me.",0
"I'm sorry to say that being this was the worst experience I had in Vegas. The customer service is horrible. On this occasion we where trying to buy a cake for my friends bday party celebration an this stop definitely ruined the party. The ""manager"" was rude and kept ignoring me while I was explaining what I needed. I will never come back here. The service and the attitude we received from the employees were enough for us to go some place else. If you want to come here I suggest have lots and lots of patience or just try a different bakery.",0
"I wish I could give this place a lower star. I was visiting Vegas for a work thing and we decided we wanted to get a cake for someones birthday and figured let's do Carlo's because it's located in the same place we were staying and having watched the Cake Boss for a while, I was interested to taste the flavors. We called in a cake to be picked up the next day, got a chocolate cake that said happy birthday on it, it was supposed to feed 20$. So I show up about half an ( on September 9th at 4:30pm) hour after the pick up time to grab my cake and hop into the ""pick-up"" line. Probably wait 15-20 minutes until I'm next in line. I am about to talk to the cashier girl when she calls out a name ( which she wasn't doing before) and this girl behind me jumps out and goes and talks to the cashier and pays for her food. Im like what just happened. I am about to talk to the cashier girl when she calls another person, Ashley, and before Ashley cuts me I go up to the girl and I explain that I am not Ashley but I have a cake that should be ready that I need to pick up ( at this point I'm running short on time as I didn't assume it would take an hour). The girl is all like oh I'll have to get someone else to do that and then proceeds to say it is going to be $20 to which I was surprised and was like I thought it was more, and she goes are you Ashley? And I'm like no ?? I already explained whats going on. Anyways she doesn't say anything else she just calls out the Ashley name again and Ashley pops over and pays for her food and the cashier continues to ignore me. I'm like getting real annoyed at this point because the lady isn't even acknowledging me. Eventually she goes and gets some else to grab my food and I wait another 15 minutes for this guy to come back which in this time the people behind me are asking if I'm in line for pickup because cashier girl is completely ignoring the line and this point and just calling people willy nilly. Eventually I get my cake, when I ask for a knife to cut it all they have is a tiny plastic butter knife and when i ask for my receipt they give me a frosting covered piece of paper. I wouldn't be this annoyed except the cake was over $70 and tasted like a generic sheet cake you can get from your local grocery store ( majority of the cake was bad frosting) :) Moral of the story these guys suck and I'm sure the cake boss's store is just a front for money laundering because I have no idea how they are still in business otherwise.",0
"The cake was great, however nothing I couldn't get at Grand luxury cafe for less time. I gave two stars because we waited 25 minutes because the bakery was so inefficiently run in order to create a line and grab interest. That is a fail like. When we could have been out in/out in 5 minutes.",0
"So I can't comment on the food from here but the service we received here today was nothing short of inexcusable. I'm not one to post rant reviews as I'm in the service industry out here and realize most are bs. We came in I the bakery and pulled a ticket. Looking in the case at all the baked goodies and literally 30 seconds had gone by and they called the number before we could see what number we where. We asked a question about something in the case and the clown behind the counter turned in to a ass responding in a aggressive tone, ""I have already called that number three times what do you want"". Now mind you we have been in the store a whopping 3 minutes. The guy proceeds to be a dick with the manager standing right beside him and acts like everything is fine. When she realizes we are unhappy her only response was, maybe he is having a bad day. I get it, you don't reprimanded employees out on the floor but you don't pretend like nothing is wrong. I could care less if your having a bad day. Welcome to the tourist industry buddy put on a smile and pretend to be nice to the people that come in to spend money. We had family that came into town a had two things she wanted to do while she was here. One was to go to this place. Shame on the clown behind the counter and shame on the manager for not being able I do her job.",0
You wait for hours because the service is slow. They don't mange the lines that well so people sneak in. I waited only because I wanted a cannoli and at noon when I entered they were out! If they are so popular they should bake more or at least post a sign saying they are out. I was very excited and now I'm just disappointed. When I watched the show they seem like a nice family run place now it's clearly all about the money. Good places like this loose credibility when they expand just to make money.,0
"My first trip to one of these highly anticipated locations on the west side & it was a COMPLETE disappointment! We ordered the tiramisu, a chocolate chip cookie & cannoli. The cookie was hard & stale, cannoli filling was gritty & tiramisu overpriced for what we ate. I think Buddy needs to re-visit this location for some retraining in the kitchen.",0
"Been here the last three times we have been to Vegas. Although the desserts we have ordered have been good, they have been out of Buddy's famous cannolis two of those three times we visited. Not sure how that happens.",0
Worst service ever and was told they are out of canollis at Carlos Bakery and the person behind the counter with pink hair was horrible,0
Everything LOOKED delicious...I got the strawberry shortcake. The only good thing on there was the strawberries and the whip cream. Cake was dry. My friend got the cheesecake and he needed water to wash it down because it was dry. How can cheesecake be dry?? My other friend got a cupcake and she also said it was dry. All the cakes are the same batter. Not worth the money. We ended up finding a fountain to sit by since there were only 4 stools in the place.,0
"Very disappointing. I went there on 4/3/16. I ordered two cannolis (one regular, one chocolate), a cookie, and a vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting. The regular cannoli was pretty good but a little grainy. The chocolate one was hard to eat. The chocolate was thick and hard but overall it was okay. They forgot the cookie. The cupcake was disgusting. It was dense and not sweet at all. It tasted like raw flour. My toddler took a bite and spit it out. I tried to eat it but had to throw it out.",0
"Basing this review entirely on the terrible service received tonight. The entire staff consisted of young kids tonight. Had a cashier who started off polite but when he saw we were a party of ten, he got rude. Mind you, we only ordered 4 freakin items. That is 4 items for a little over FIFTY dollars! In the most asshole tone this kid turns to the girl packaging orders and goes, I need a lobster tail AND strawberries AND cake AND another slice of cake. Excuse me? Sorry for the inconvenience. You'd think that was it but the ""runner"" had an attitude as big as the Venetian itself. She shorted us one slice of cake so when this was brought to her attention she rudely says can I help you??? (Clearly inconvenienced) I proceed to tell her she missed a slice of cake and she starts to ARGUE with me about what I ordered and paid for. Until finally she was proven wrong by the guy at the register. Turns out I was right, thank you very much. I told her thanks for the attitude as she handed me my missing item after telling me I was wrong when I wasn't. And as I was walking out another woman proceeded to call her a bitch!!! Goes to show you what kind of staff they've got working. Get it together and hire someone worthwhile!",0
"Listen if you see a huge line don't wait, if the line is ok wait and try the pastries. I just promise one thing you won't be impressed, at least I wasn't These are the prices for what I ordered : Large Cannoli $3.95 , French NapoleÃ³n $7.50 , and the total was $12.39 & btw they only accepted cash ! So disappointing because my expectations were a bit too high I guess.",0
"Terrible crumb cake, hard as a rock and since it was bitten into, ""they could not do anything"". I was supposed to just touch and decide it was nasty.",0
"I called to place a phone order and was hung up on when I asked if the lines where long?! No, slam!! Thanks B$@ch it's called customer service if you don't like what your doing for a living than find another job! Maybe one that involves you in a closet by yourself",0
"Ordered the chocolate cupcake and one of the worst cupcakes I ever tasted. Over-cooked and $4. I forced myself to swallow my only bite and threw the rest away after my girlfriend tried a piece and had same reaction. Big disappointment, don't waste your time or money!!!!",0
"All hype, the location is definitely tourists located, not worth the wait however the items here are decent you can get the same quality at any bakery or pizzeria",0
"I love Carlos Bake shop, and I have the highest respect for Buddy and his family business. I went to this location for the first time two months ago while travelling through Vegas, and the lobster tails were phenomenal. They had a French/Irish cream folded into the cream. It was worth the price. We went back today (only two months later) and ordered 6 of them to go. At $6 each.. when we got to eating them we were all severely disappointed that the famous lobster tails we love only had plain whipped cream in them. I do not think Buddy would approve of this location changing his recipe and selling this sub par product in his name. I never thought I would write a bad review about Carlos Bake shop.",0
"I love the cake boss show and all of their spin off Shows as well. It's been a long time that I've been waiting to try Buddie's bakery goods, specially their red velvet cupcake as Carlos so many times teaches other bakers how to master it and it's staple cream cheese frosting. So, after 20 minutes in line my husband and I finally got to the ordering panel. By the time we got there, there was no tiramisu. So my husband ordered a strawberry short cake. I ordered the oh so famous red velvet cupcake. After another 15 minutes waiting for our order, we finally got our goods. Everything was just ok. I was NOT expecting just ok! The red velvet cupcake looked like a cupcake I can get at traders joe's. Tasted ok, nothing woow! My husbands strawberry short cake was tasty, but not tasty enough for that price. Even an amazing dessert at a fancy place is slightly cheaper!!!! I wanted to love this place! But, not impressed at all!",0
"I really wanted to like this place. I waited in line for almost an hour, which I was willing to do. I thought the experience was cool- to watch the bakers and the service was well organized but none of the pastries were impressive! we order the tiramisu, canolis, cheese cake, crumb cake, boston cream cake, snow balls. I would rather eat at the Bouchon bakery nearby.",0
"What a shame. Definitely hasn't lived up to the hype. The cupcakes are extremely dense (almost bagel like) and taste store bought. They were barely average. Also we bought the blue cake with brown polka dots that is shown on the show quite a bit. Just average and kind of chemically in taste. On the bright side, the cream puffs were amazing. Overall, it most certainly wasn't worth the hour wait and was way over-priced. We live near Retro Bakery in the NW part of town. Their cupcakes and cakes are WAY better than C.B.'s desserts.",0
"I love to bake so I love going to bakeries and checking them out. Seeing Buddy on tv led me to believe that his pastries would be top notch since he always seemed so caught up on quality on his shows. The pastries were very over priced (I paid $21 for a small canoli, a cookie, a Napoleon, and a lobster tail) and were a bit of a disappointment. They seemed a little soggy and not fresh. Honestly, not worth going to.",0
Okay I get it it's a place from tv.... But to be honest this place isn't that amazing. First off the lady who took my order shorted me on not one but two things! And it took her 5x's as long as any other person to pack it. They need someone too double check the orders before they send it out! I mean come on they pretty much stole 10$ from us.,0
"Huge line to get in, about half an hour which made me think it must be good. When we get to front we are rushed to choose and asked if we can decide quickly because if the line. Not only is that rude, but the world famous bakery wasn't worth the wait whatsoever. We ordered chocolate covered cannoli and Oreo cake. We were all disappointed and pretty much were thinking we wasted a half hour. No where to sit, rude worker handling line, rude worker taking order and rude cashier. Will not go back.",0
"They get one star because their pastries are actually tasty and almost worth their expensive prices. However, the bakery is extremely inconsistent with their supply, and their employees lie about when they will have certain items available. They have tons of generic cookies and cupcakes available regularly, but are always low or out of their specialty italian desserts that I assume most people would particularly go there for. One example, during my last trip about a week ago, I went to the bakery at about 6pm on a Sunday with the intention of getting some cannolis. I was told that they ran out and was assured that they would be available again in the morning when they opened at 8am. After overhearing my conversation with the employee, the customers in line behind me shared their frustration with me that they were there that morning for some cannolis as well, and were told to come back in the afternoon. I decided to take my chance anyways and made my way again to the Venetian from the other end of the strip to get my cannolis the next morning before I headed home at around 10am. Of course, when I got there, the employee told me that they didn't have any and that they would MAYBE get some in the afternoon. The employee seemed annoyed that I even asked for some cannolis while pointing out that there weren't any in the display cases. (I've been here enough times to know that they often don't even display them and that they have to go get them from the back!) Horrible customer service, what a waste of time!",0
"We are visiting Las Vegas and we were so excited to try the legendary treats of Carlo's bakery. But our hopes were crushed, along with the cannolis that were out for a week because they ran out of the ingredients. We still stayed in the half hour line to at least try the cakes that people like so much. But after we made it through the conflict of the employees trying to make us us buy more of everything, we ended with this: Cannoli tower -Stale, dry, and flavorless. The only good part was the cannoli cream in the center. Red Velvet cake- Dry, flavorless, and tasted nothing like red velvet. After trying this food, we were full of sugar. We then decided to get some coffee to settle our stomachs. We waited in the line (again) to order. It was finally our turn. We ordered small coffees, but they were out of small cups. So they told us they could only sell us large cups of coffee, until we suggested that they could just fill a large cup up halfway! All in all, the only good treats were the chocolate strawberries. In my opinion, skip the Las Vegas version and try the one in Hoboken. Maybe that one lives up to the tv show. Even their cakes, which are so famous and creative on TV, in Las Vegas they look like they came straight from a local grocery store, but three times the price. #Disappointed.",0
"Came in here for cannolis and wanted to try the lobster tail. When I arrived, no one was there which was nice and they still had cannolis and lobster tails. I ordered 2-cannolis, 2 salted caramel lobster tails and one cookies n creme lobster tail. The cannolis were good, but the lobster tails not so much. The shells; while good, I think were slightly over baked. The filling on the salted caramel had no caramel flavor at all and the filling for the cookies n creme only had a hint of cookies n creme flavor. My mom tried one of the salted caramel lobster tails and agreed they had no flavor. Disappointed that I paid $26 for 5 pastries that werent amazing.",0
"As many people have reported: Dry, basic tasting cupcakes. I am a huge fan of Cake Boss so this was a bit distressing after having waited in a line for so long to get it. The staff is not the best: First me and my fiance were treated rudely by the lady working the line( she clearly was more concerned about getting off work than being helpful and doing her job. Then when ordering (I've never had a cannoli) I asked if the connoli had chocolate because my fiance is allergic and he said no. We were nearly about to chow down when the worker advised us that there was chocolate. Long story short I will stick with the bakeries out in my city. I do have to say some of the cookies were nice but then again how do you mess up a cookie.",0
Everything we had was dry and definitely not worth the calories. We got 2 cupcakes a cannoli and 3 different cookies. The only think that was good was the frosting on the chocolate cupcake. Very disappointing.,0
"I was so disappointed. I am a fan of the show so while we were in Vegas I figured it would be worth it to go. We got a chocolate mousse with strawberry cake, a lobster tail, a cannoli, and a few cookies. The lobster tail was good, but that was it. The strawberries in the cake had gone bad and ruined everything in the cake. The cannoli was inedible. It was absolutely disgusting. The cookies were Costco quality and not worth buying. I've never been to the original, but it is clear that this location does not have the same quality.",0
"Place was horrible. First and foremost, we grabbed a number which was B89 and waited over 2 hours for our number to get called. One of the most disorganized companies I have ever seen. I understand things were busy but the way of doing business was horrible and we noticed a lot of people leaving purely because of the wait. Second, once we finally got our number called, I was informed the pie that I had ordered 4 hours earlier was not made. The manager came out and spoke to me and before even apologizing, blamed it on me because I had not pre-paid. She tried to explain how the process worked if I would have pre-paid for the pie but did not apologize or offer a solution outside of waiting another 40 minutes for my pie to be made. Absolute worst customer service I have ever seen from a ""manager."" On top of that, pre-paying for my pie was never even provided to me as an option which only made things worse. Would not recommend this to anyone unless you are looking to waste a few hours on the strip and if you don't want to get your order correct.",0
"The quality/price ratio is pretty low...e.g. $11 for a mini cheese cake 3.5"" in diameter, or ""genuine italian cannoli"" made without fresh ricotta cheese. If you wanna get in you have to queue for almost an hour. There's limited seats and it's not nice to eat your pastries there, you'll have to get it to go...which makes it even more expensive, considering that it's essentially a to go place. The staff is friendly. Overall, you can find much better pastries for that price or even less.",0
When i went into the bakery i was greeted and was asked what i would like. As i was looking i instantly realized that the prices are more than anyone else charges. It was to expensive for me. I got a pastry and noticed that it wasn't that great for the price. Porto's is better than this place. This Bakery is just novelty.,0
"I waited in line for 45 minutes to get mediocre pastries, which was very disappointing. As I observed the line, I was really stunned by how inefficient they are. I think they like the line to be long to build hype, but most people are just there because of the show. Don't bother.",0
"My fam and I are huge fans of the show, have been since the beginning. Needless to say when we heard Buddy was opening up shop in LV, we were stoked and could not wait to finally try some of the yummy treats we had seen on the show. Sadly, we were highly disappointed - twice! We decided to get my father a Canoli cake for his birthday this year (6/18/14 - ""the big 66, retirement at last!"") too bad it could not be a memorable one where his cake took center stage. The cake is very different looking from the pics on the website which I guess only apply to the Hoboken location. There were no almond slivers around the cake, the cream was kind of heavy and very bland on the upside the vanilla sponge was ok, just sad that all together it was not good. We also had the mini canoli, original and chocolate, my daughters thought they were ok - nothing special. I had the Napoleon, this was the WORST thing I have ever put in my mouth in the disguise of a dessert. The French cream was hard and you could tell had been sitting around for a while, the flaky pastry layers were more like thin sheets of cardboard, they were tough and hard to bite through, I almost broke a tooth trying to bite through it, after a couple attempts, the Napoleon was totally destroyed and looked like a firecracker went off in it - for sure had been sitting around for a while. Lastly, the lines are redonkulous! We waited for over an hour and a half on a Sat. night and it was so wrong to see the favoritism on behalf of the young, chubby white guy who was at the door letting people in. We saw him let in, 2 pretty, young ladies - totally bypassed the line and walked right in, about 20 minutes later he did it again with a ""punk rocker, tattooed, pierced, pink haired (one side the other shaved) girl."" Maybe he feared this one - LOL. So sorry Buddy, we really did want to love your desserts, but hopefully you can make the necessary changes to save this place. We will for sure try it again in the future with hopes that the third time is a charm! #fingerscrossed #bringthejumbocrumbcaketoLV",0
Took over an hour to get some okay cookies. It's not the product although just okay but the service. Only two people helping customers. Sure buddy could afford a little more help. As my wife stood in line I watched the operation behind the counter. OMG one guy waited on approximately 4 customers in an hour as he walked around lost and took over 10 minutes to put on some latex gloves. The cashier leans on the counter when she rings something ever 5 minutes. Get some more help and upgrade your staff they are awful.,0
"honestly, my local grocery store is better. Lower your expectations. Cupcakes tasted very artificial! Sprinkles is much better!",0
I'm only giving this place one star because I didn't get to eat here. Why? Because they do a piss poor job in guiding you to this bitch. On the casino floor they advertise it everywhere. Then you start looking for it and there are no signs anywhere!! I had to ask 4 people that just told me to keep going. It's in BFE. Next to Rockhouse where you can't go any further. Now my family has lost interest. Put up signs to guide people here!!!! I'm sweating from the long walk here!!!! Damn!!!!,0
I was expecting it to be better. I got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average. I've had better at a supermarket. I love cake boss so I was hoping this would be good. I'll just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods.,0
Not what you would expect after watching the show rather have went to trader joes and got dessert,0
First time customer and I was not very impressed. I think they focus more on quantity over quality - the lines were out the door and when we stopped and went back to our room to eat we were shocked we paid so much for mediocre desserts,0
It was alright! I guess I expected more! Nothing out of the ordinary but I'm hoping the restaurant will be better.,0
Ew. Anyone who can bake at home following a free recipe from a cookbook or blog can produce higher quality and better tasting baked goods than this. Why does this guy have a show...artistic flare? Stuff was pretty but Ew.,0
"I am very disappointed ,i was in Vegas in the weekend of the Columbus Day holiday and I was pass by the Carlos Bakery and I was spend good money ,including cannolis and my surprise went I open the box in my home in California ,that's not cannolis in the box . I was send a email to them by web site and they don't care . Poor customer service ,I think I will not buy anything there never.",0
The staff sucks the lady at the register was extremely rude and rolled her eyes when we asked for napkins. These were the worst desserts I've ever tasted in my life. Carlo's bakery sucks all the way around. I threw it all away not even my dog would eat it. I will never think of cake boss the same way again.,0
I don't think people who rate 5 4 stars knows what the hell they are talking about trust me being from NY Brooklyn can tell you Carlos bake shop is rated low on Brooklyn New Jersey great chart. The reason people think it is great and taste YUMMY as a lot of you call it is because your mind tricks you in thinking you are tasting something great since slice bread! Trust me he's pastries are ok but not great just below avg.,0
Buddy has always been an inspiration to me ever since I was little. For this exact reason we drove all the way to Las Vegas to visit his bakery. I decided to order the cannoli because that is their special dish and their lobster tail. I also got a cupcake and a brownie. I was all excited to eat it but when I tried the cannoli it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tried in my life it was super sweet and tasted like oil. The lobster tail was bad enough to because it tasted like egg and lard. The cupcake was dry and tasted like nothing.lastly the brownie was good but if your not a chocolate fan do not get it. Overall experience is do not go unless you want bad quality dessert that you could get cheaper and better at the supermarket.,0
"I have been a Buddy fan since he won the baking competition that lead to him getting his show on TLC. I have also been a fan of his competition show and cooking show. Living in L.A I never had an opportunity to try any of his baked goods. My niece just got married in Vegas and just wanted something ""small and nice"" to use to ""cut the cake"" since neither of them were big cake eater. I immediately suggested Carlo's Bakery. I raved about Buddy and the show and told them it should be a great experience. It was not. The staff was dismissive and and the red velvet cupcakes and mini cheesecakes we bought were sub par to say the least. I was shocked. I feel the quality and ""familia"" atmosphere has gone down to expansion and profit. What a shame.",0
"Stop by here around 5pm, there was a long line approximately 25 persons at the front of us, no sure why the line was so long. I decided go to check out what they have when my friends waited in the line, I noticed the lobster croissant with cream inside, cheese cake....etc. If you keep eyes in your calories taken during day, you should NOT come here. Also their cakes aren't cheap. End up I didn't buy any because the cakes aren't healthy making and too much fat.",0
Disappointment Buddy ! The grocery store pastries are way better then this . NEVER AGAIN,0
"Went to this place when we visited Vegas for a wedding.. I love the show so I figured the 2.5 hour line was worth it... We'll, not so much. While I must admit the selection and display is beautiful, I wasn't blown away by the taste of their product. My cannoli cream was gritty and the shell wasn't very crisp by time I got to eat it. My fudge cupcake- frosting was okay but I myself make better.. And finally, I got this cake thing- it was white chocolate mousse covered with chocolate. The mousse was WAY!! To sweet, and I wish the chocolate shell would have had a crunch to it. I know I bought some other items too, but overall I wasn't too empresses.. Waiting 2.5 hours and paying about $30 for something that I could make or buy in Wisconsin tasting better and cheaper than this place, why'd I even come?? Should have listened to my mom and just taken the picture outside and gotten desserts someplace else..",0
"I did not like the canoli and the the tiramisu tasted like a lot of whip cream. We tried the red velvet and it was just okay. The brownie with walnuts were good but basically with what we got, I wasn't wowed enough to really go back. Carlos really must be a favorite on the east coast but at the prices of the bakery items I just wasn't impressed.",0
"Went to Vegas and checked them out because I love watching their show and curious but I was disappointed. Nothing special and they are expensive. Ordered canoli and lobster tail, meh! Waste of money :(",0
We went to this bakery December 2014 . Waiting in line for an hour we got to the front and ordered 2 chocolate cupcakes . Looking forward to eating a delicious cupcake. I sat down with my boyfriend after taking a bite I was very disappointed. The cupcake was dry and tastes worse than a zinger. Not only dry but the quality was very poor. The beautiful box packing is very deceiving . I do not recommend this bakery. Thumbs down,0
"I went in about 20 minutes ago. The girls in there made you feel so unwelcomed. The girl taking our order basically rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could look at the cupcakes once the people ahead of us were done. Any question was just an annoyance to her. Then, they forgot a lot of our pastries. I don't know how she could've forgotten when she wrote it all down. But, they definitely didn't forget to charge us for it. It's not with going in unless you want someone treating you like you're bothering them.",0
"2 Massive lines , we ordered a birthday cake and had to wait a while in line 20 minutes to get it. Not to mention park and walk A mile. It wasn't boxed up and scheduled to be picked up at 5. It was almost 7. Floors and all glass was dirty. Too much fondant and too expensive. No way I'd go back there",0
I have been to Carlo's bakery before and the line was a bit long but I didn't care because I was excited to try it. I got the lobster tail and it was good. I recently went back again on November 1st and they was no line at all. The staff was there but no one would help me. After standing there for at least 5 mins I ask the girl do I order here or at the register she said someone will be with you in a bit. Really!!! I was the only one there. So I waited and they finally helped me. I ordered my items then she said someone will ring you up in a bit. I waited and waited until a guy went to the register never made eye contact and blurred out the total twice. I said oh is that my total? I didn't know you were helping me. Very rude staff and unprofessional. The baked goods were not worth the wait nor the treatment.,0
"I drove to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, CA just to go to Carlo's Bakery. I have been to the one in New Jersey and New York and it was great. The pastries there tasted fantastic, so I was expecting the same in Vegas. Unfortunately, it was not great. I had to throw away the cannoli because it tasted bad. I only ate half of these cheesecake/chocolate mousse because it tasted weird. They did not have much of a variety. They didn't have velvet cupcakes and no strawberry shortcake; they were working on them. It was a big disappointment.",0
"I was a bit surprised...selection was limited, a bit ""Safeway"" 'sh if that makes sense...I wouldn't go back actually. Not much to select as far as cakes go, and didn't seem very Italian either. Disappointing.",0
"Is this location owned by Buddy?? Well I was not impressed. I purchased a cupcake and a cannoli, the cupcake had no flavor, was dry and stuck to the cup paper. As for the cannoli it did not impress me, tasted a bit stale. Is this what Carlos bakery items really taste? Like Cardboard? Save your money, go get a Ghirardelli ice cream sundae instead.",0
"We were so excited to try this bakery. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. The line was long. We had to take a number and waited about half hour to purchase our sweets. We bought a few cupcakes and a few cannolis. The cannolis were ok but nothing memorable. The cupcakes were dry and tasted old. I doubt they were baked the day we bought them. Save your money! If you want delicious cupcakes, go to Sprinkles in the Linq.",0
My wife and I bought 3 mini canolis last night when we open the box this morning it's just 1..,0
"Don't bother unless you just want to say you have gone to Carlo's Bakery. We waited in a long line for about 45 minutes to get in $35 dollars later it was a disappointment. We bought the lobster tail, which was extremely dry, hard, and not tasty, the cannoli was hard as a rock, the chocolate chip cookie was alright nothing special, the only thing I enjoyed was the brownie. It was moist, but nothing special. We ate at his restaurant which is right across from the bakery, and the dessert was worth it. It was delicious and tasty. Don't bother with the bakery go straight to the restaurant instead and have dessert there. They serve it to you fresh.",0
"Despite ordering and paying in full over 2 months in advance Carlo's did not make our wedding cake for our wedding day as contracted. We did not find out until we went to pick it up on the wedding day. To make things worse the supervisor had no idea how to use the computer to make things right, it took myself (The Groom) going down there during the reception along with 3 other people to make a scene and push them to just refund us cash and make a new cake on the spot, which was obviously extremely thrown together and not what we ordered. This caused a big delay in our party while all our guests waited for me to get back to the reception. Their excuse was that some hand off did not happen internally. I understand things happen but you do not just forget to make a wedding cake. Though the cash was refunded and we did end up with some kind of cake it doesn't make up for the guests missing out on the cake I specifically ordered and myself missing 45 minutes of my own reception. Do not use Carlo's catering for any event if you want your dessert as contracted.",0
$3.50 for the worst cupcake EVER! Frosting is not real buttercream. I work in the canal shoppes and couldn't wait to find a good bakery. I'm so glad I rated first before getting a birthday cake,0
"This is opening week, hopefully the ordering and serving process gets revised. I stop in for my free cannoli and a cup of coffee this morning. Placed my order and they wrote it down. Wth it's coffee and cannoli just serve it. I wait 15 minutes for my cannoli to be put in a bag and rung up at the register. I get to the register and the coffee isn't ready yet. Wow. The cannoli wasn't the ricotta cannoli you would get in Philly or New York, it was more the icing filling kind. Wasn't impressed. The other pastries looked good.",0
"I watch the show, I liked the show. I thought his commitment to excellence was admirable and I so wanted to try his deserts. FAIL!!! This is all media hype and the deserts were bland, sub par and very expensive. The wait is a min of thirty minutes and the staff were all smug and seemed to be in a bad mood. I am Italian American, my maternal grandfather came straight from Italy to New York and was a baker. That being said I grew up with these pastries and I know how they should taste and believe me this is just CRAP. I distinctly remember an episode of the Next Great Baker when Buddy was pissed at the fact that the cup cakes were not filled to capacity. The (Famous) red velvet cupcake I had at Carlos was filled less then 3/4 of the way to the top of the paper, there was a tiny amount of frosting set all the way to one side and it looked like something your kid sister made in Jr High and as far as taste goes is was horribly dry and almost frozen. I've had red velvet cupcakes from Ralph's grocery store that were moist and tastier.",0
I was surprised and disappointed with the taste of cupcakes. I am sure we can find much more better taste bakery in this town and other states. I can't find any special their taste and decorations. Of course better than the one we buy from supermarket but Just little better. Smells good around the bakery also I don't smell artificial smell. But the frosting taste artificial ingredients but of course little better than the one we buy from the super market. Is it just the power of the Media?! I hope the original bakery is much better taste. If not that is not fair!!,0
"The wait time wasn't very long, but I would think that with such a popular bakery that there would be a better system of ordering:( you have to wait in a line that cuts in front of the door, then you only see the pastries that are in front of you, not past you because there are people in line. By the time it's your turn you need to know exactly what you want because the girls helping act like they don't have time to wait for you to decide. Out of the 3 girls working, I was hoping to get the one that seemed to like being there (we did) whew... Cannolis were okay, lobster tails a little hard, crumb bun (skip it very dry, you will need milk or coffee). I'll still watch the shows, but won't be visiting the bakery again. Go to Bouchon Bakery around the corner baked goods are amazing, staff super friendly, and prices are reasonable.",0
"I am not at all a fan of the Cake Boss. I've never seen the show. However my cousin is and is the reason for my recent visit to Carlos's Bakery. When we got there the line wasn't as long as I expected from pictures that I've seen which I was pleased with. It was about a 25 minute wait to even get inside the bakery. When we finally got inside and waited for someone available to take our order the man didn't even look at me or ask if I had been helped before he greeted the lady behind me. I quickly said hello to him to get his attention, only then did he realize he skipped over me. My cousin and I had been standing for a while looking so we already had our order ready. I watched the man write down my order correctly and stepped aside to wait to be called. He called me over to check if my order was write. It was missing two things. I don't understand how you forget two things when you wrote it down and the case is literally two inches in front of your face, not to mention it wasn't a very big order. So I'm finally called up to pay and the women repeats my order back to me before charging me and everything she repeated was correct. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed she charged me for a ""large chocolate cannoli"" and not a ""large chocolate chip cookie"" even though she repeated back ""cookie."" The cannoli does cost more than the cookie so I was very upset with that. No one in this place has any sense of urgency. Everyone just kind of shuffles around slowly as if they didn't have a crowd outside of the door. When we sat down to eat our desserts I was desperately hoping they would at least be good enough to make all this worth it. But of course they weren't. All the desserts tasted like any other bakery. They weren't bad but weren't anything special either. If I wanted average food I would go to a regular bakery. The lobster tail was good, I'll give them that. But that's about the only good thing I have to say about it. All in all I would have to say I would never recommend this place to anyone. The workers are incompetent, the food is average and very over priced, and the wait time is ridiculous.",0
"Was so excited to eat one of Buddy's cannoli's. it was nothing special. The cannoli left a funny coating in your mouth, maybe the grease from the deep fryer? I tried a chocolate meringue OMG it was so hard at 8:20 in the morning nearly broke a tooth, no joke.. The cupcakes red velvet, and the flower one was no big deal.. The Cupcakery and Give Me Sugar make better ones..I did like the pecan wedge dipped in chocolate, it was very good and the apple turn over. The Cannoli' tower was expensive and had NO flavor. Spent 36.00 for blah pastries. I am a local, I spread the word on good food. I was an avid diner of Max Brenner's dining there once a week, because it was good and unique. I took everyone I knew who came to town there. Sadly ceaser's did not renew their lease, so they closed. Thought Carlos would take it's place, but it won't. My husband wants to buy our 30 wedding anniv. cake their but I am not sure?? Maybe he should have brought the staff from Carlos to Vegas for training?? The staff also was very disorganized, calling our number 5 times, each time I told them I had been helped, They were not busy Monday morning at 8:20 a.m also did not have Lobster tails, that is what I went there for... Cannoli and Lobster tails... I love Cake Boss, and all the shows Buddy, but Carlos bakery was a Huge disappointment. Won't be back sorry.. I am a local, and am always trying new places, and when it's good everyone will hear about it.. This was not... Staff didn't even know how to make coffee in the automatic brewers, felt bad for the guy behind us..love Buddy, but not the bakery... I took tons of photos for my facebook page, but they looked better than they tasted... so sad...",0
Bad ordering system.... take numbers only 3 people working in front that does everything take order fill order and cashier. Didn't order anything just left and I noticed a whole lot of others left too. Not preparing to wait over an hour..... BAD Management,0
"My boyfriend and I didn't mind waiting the 45 min because it was Carlos Bakery. I ordered the mini cheesecake with fruit, he had the raspberry tart. I kid you not the cheesecake had no flavor and the raspberry tart was two dried cookies with jam in the middle. I wouldnt have minded paying for overpriced pastries if they were any good. Sadly they were TERRIBLE. Don't waste an hour of your life on below par crap. Makes me wonder if Carlos bakery is just pure hype. Zero stars",0
Word of caution to anyone who orders online: be prepared to wait. We spent nearly a half hour waiting for service just to find out the order was not ready. The cake is actually quite good if they're able to work out the management issues.,0
"Way overpriced and the desserts didn't taste as good as I expected. I didn't see pricing for anything, got to the register it was over $50 for 5 items! I expected so much more and was sorely disappointed. I've had better from the local grocery store bakery.",0
"Ordered the chocolate lobster and the standard lobster. Both had exteriors like leather and had no flavor. The filing although overfilled did not make up for the exterior pastry. Also tried the carrot cake, which had a granular texture for the cake portion and the icing tasted like fondant vs cream cheese. NOT worth spending any amount of money for!!!",0
"This place is expensive. I guess you would call it Vegas (tourist) prices!!! From the show, lobster tails and cannolis are their specialty. Nothing fantastic, lobster tail is like croissant with pastry cream and the cannoli has a ricotta filling. They sell a small box of assorted butter cookies for just under $10.00 and I mean small!! Been there, no need to go back!!",0
"Disappointed! I had a big event going on in vegas for a friends birthday and I only wanted the best of the best cakes and since I'm a huge fan of Carlo's bakery (I own all of his baking books!) I decided to place a cake order on June 5th weeks in advance everything was set until my friend got really ill and we needed to cancel our trip. I called about 8 days before I needed it and cancelled it. They said they couldn't give me my $98 back but that they would give me a gift card to use at any Carlos bakery as well on the website. I was 100% happy with that and I didn't mind at all. But! It's now July 28th and I still haven't received anything. I called them twice about it and although they are very nice, they need to learn how to work the phone because I got put on hold and hung up on like 3 times. Both times I've called they apologize and they say they are sending it out but it's been over a MONTH already and still haven't received my gift card! Come on Carlos Bakery get with it guys! Disappointed fan!!!!!!",0
Was wanting to get chocolaye chip cookies all gone cant believe it because its always busy you think theyed make more so i got 2 mm cookies very stale and double chocolate chip also stale all for over $11 so disappointed im deciding if i should walk back and complain but maybe ill just suck it up and never buy there again and taste like box cookies,0
"Very unwelcoming staff. Long line which moves fairly fast and now I know why it does. They treat you like the number you are supposed to pick. They rush you expecting you to know what you want. I have 4 kids and they wanted to take a peek around. The girl behind the counter snapped at me because I was unsure of what I was ordering so I guess I mispronounced it. Sorry... Again just like Buddy Vs the pastries were good but because of the lack of customer service you got that cold, unwelcome and unwanted experience. So disheartening. We were there for my daughter's birthday who wants to be a baker because of Buddy and she felt again personally let down by Buddy himself.",0
"Twice now, treats from this joint have given my family food poisoning. They have a sign saying to keep everything you purchase refrigerated, so I imagine this is an ongoing problem. First, my husband got sick off a cookie six months ago. This morning my daughter is sick after have a cupcake for dessert last night. Never again. Obviously they have an issue if they expect everyone to eat cold pastries. Maybe they need to cook things properly in the first place. Have heard from a friend she and her family have become ill after eating here. Too bad, had hoped it was just my family. Feel for people on vacation who get sick here.",0
Everything tastes like it has been sitting out all day. Nothing fresh but the raspberry on my mousse tart. Cookies are hard,0
"Waited in line for an hour. Then another 15-20 after placing order for 1 cookie and a red velvet cupcake. Cookie was average, cupcake was dry and bland. Lots of hype but did not deliver for us.",0
Seriously not that great. You wain like half hour in line and then you feel rushed. The floor is dirty and the customer service is ok. The only thing we came back for are the lobster rolls (@ 5.95 each). Other than that none of the bread is worth the calories. Just selling the name at a crazy price.,0
"Ordered a gluten free truffle cake and other items. When we got back to our hotel and opened the box, they had packed the gluten free cake in the same closed box as the non gluten free items. Ever heard of cross contamination? When I called, they apologized and then proceeded to ask if I requested it be packed separate. I said no I didn't think it was necessary it should have been a given. The manager then states that the cake was in the same case as the other items. Nice way to justify the mistake made by her employee. I guess it was my fault going there in the first place.",0
"As a cake/cupcake caterer, I like to try my ""competition"" to see what I'm up against. I have considered Buddy more than competition, since he's way out of my league, however, after tasting 3 different cupcakes (S'Mores, chocolate w/vanilla buttercream, and vanilla w/chocolate buttercream), I am completely underwhelmed. The cake was good (nothing out of the ordinary), but the buttercream was no better than what I could get at my local Safeway! Shortening based buttercream? Seriously???? Bleh!!! Also, the S'Mores cupcake was the same vanilla with chocolate buttercream, only they charge $1 more to add some broken graham crackers on top. Zero marshmallow anywhere on or in the cupcake. How can you call it S'Mores without marshmallow??? The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the cannoli. It was good. They ought to use the filling to frost their cupcakes! Overall impression, pretty on the outside, but overpriced and bland on the inside- just like Vegas!",0
"Went for the first time today! Was so excited until i tried the Cannoli. The number one rule is that the WHOLE thing is filled with creme. When i got into the middle of mine there was a big gap. Not ok and your staff needs to be a little mature, maybe higher older people!",0
"Bought a caramel cupcake and 2 small pecan snowball cookies. Cookies were dry and flavorless, probably not fresh. Cupcake was so dry, I had to drink in between bites to get it down. Icing was very soft and due to the cupcake being old/stale, the icing completely slid off the cupcake inside the box. I paid $6.71 for these three items. Skip this place.",0
"Great pastries, but the service has went downhill. We come here every time we're in Vegas and the service we received this weekend (3 times mind you) it got worse every time we came. The last day we were there I called in my order which is required to be prepaid and still waited in line for 20 minutes and were treated like we didn't even exist. Very disappointed in the service.",0
"The pastries were fabulous! Especially the lobster tails. However, trying to buy gift cards for a wedding present was a nightmare. It took three trips to get them. I finally did. I emailed Carlo's Bakery letting them know. Took forever to get a response. When I did, they said someone from the location contact me. No one did. I emailed again. Someone emailed offering to sent me the gift card sleeves, even after I advised that I had given the gift. The last email advised that they were sending me the sleeves and two coupons for a free cannoli! To be used at any location! Yeah! Wait...I live in CA & there is no location here. Got the coupons today's. Not only are they for a location we don't have, they expire in three months. So much for the attention to detail they rave about on the show",0
"Ugh, what a letdown. Huge lines and lots of buzz, but when it came time to eat the pastry itself it was horrible. Had the creme horn - something was ""off"" in general and didn't taste right, but that was overshadowed by the outer cake's consistency, which was as if uncooked pasta was wrapped around it - a hard, practically unchewable, outer layer. I assume it's supposed to be crispy? I can't imagine that's what they were going for... terrible.",0
"I went to Carlo's in Vegas and I was looking forward to it. I waited in line for quite a while, maybe 20 or 30 minutes. The boy who was ushering people in through the velvet rope was busy chatting and a couple who were never in line walked right up to the counter and were waited on! I got the California cheesecake. It was okay, I've had better. It was $10.00. I also bought a mug for $10.00. They put them both in a white plastic bag that said Thank You like you get from Stop and Shop. Very embarrassing having to walk around a beautiful hotel like the Venetian with a Stop and Shop bag. When I met up again with my other family who went on the Gondola ride, one of my couisins said ""Gee, you would think they would want to give you at a bag with their logo on it."" Very,very disappointing.",0
"I really think this place is overrated, the canoli was average and the puff pastry whipped cream was way too sweet. I had high expectations and I was let down. Everyone has different opinions some love it some of us don't. I personally would not go back.",0
"I have watched many episodes of cake boss and have wanted to go to the cake shop for 3 years. I finally got to go there this Summer, and was very disappointed with the deserts. I tried the brownie which was really hard and the chocolate covered cheesecake was just OK and the chocolate eclair didn't taste as good either. Overall i would not recommend this place I just think it is over hyped.",0
"Horrible, super unimpressed. We were so excited to taste their product and spent a lot of money bc we wanted to try a little bit of everything that we see them make on the show. So so disappointed. We really expected to be wowed. The stuff was dry, no flavor, a lot of items taste the same. It was nothing special, I was so bummed out.",0
"You want it to be awesome. You have this building sense of excitement as you walk the Grand Canal Shops, like when you were a kid running down the stairs on Christmas morning. Then you get there.....and it's all downhill from then on. Now I grew up with these bakeries on Long Island, it's more than red and white string tied around a box that's makes an Italian bakery an Italian bakery. Buddy....what happened???? I watched my wife wait an hour for her ticket number to come up, and she had only 25 people ahead of her. Yes, you think a 3 minute wait time per customer is good right? But not when you have 3 workers on the counter assisting! Not only that, the bakery service area is about the size of a small Starbucks. Yet right across the hallway is Buddy's signature restaurant, and not only is it absolutely massive in size, it's absolutely dead inside. I saw 3 four tops, 2 bored hostesses, and a line cook that probably regrets applying for a job there. Why in the world did you not make a massive bakery area and a cute cafe type dinner place is beyond me. Seriously, you have Mario Batali just down another hall, and that's good damn Italian food. You're a baker Buddy, you should have just stuck with that and made a killing with a large, quick paced bakery cranking out our East Coast patisserie memories. Not a closet bakery with a huge show window with a guy filling cannolis. Remember, a fish may love a bird....but where would they live? BTW, the cannoli was great for what you can get on the West coast...but barely on par what I can get at my old bakery out on the Island.",0
"Friendly staff! But... The cookies, cakes, etc were not only overrated, but not even yummy. I got a couple cookies and they were all rock hard. Seriously, a cookie from a famous bakery?! Don't get me wrong, I love Cake Boss and was excited to go, but I was totally disappointed with even the basic baked goods.",0
"We were Vegas over the weekend. We had to stop at Carlo's Bake Shop. The line was so long. After picking up the desserts, we ate them. I was not impressed with them. I am disappointed. Also, I wish they had more cupcake flavors.",0
"Disappointing!!!! The line was long, the food overpriced, and bland. My family and I decided to check it out because of all the hype, but were terribly disappointed. I do not recommend it at all",0
"Poor service, cardboard cookies, flavorless cakes. A huge disappointment, everything we bought ended up in the trash uneaten. Bouchon just down the corridor is much, much better.",0
"The pastries are mediocre definitely not worth the time or money! Save your time and go to Bouchon Bakery, easily 10 times better. The staff at Carlo's bakery is incompetent, at least the night I went. We ordered 10 different items, which for some reason took them 20 minutes to box up. Before paying, the gentleman showed us the boxes and asked if it looked correct, upon examining the items we informed him that the order was not correct. Another 20 minutes went by and finally the cashier called us over, I asked her what was inside the boxes and explained how the first time around the order was screwed up, her response to me was ""I don't know, read the receipt"" (how rude!! What if I was a tourist and was illiterate?). Long story short I got to my hotel room and yet again the order was wrong!!",0
"If I could give them a score of zero to a negative star I would! My family and I love to watch cake boss! It's a great show. So when we heard that there was a cake boss bakery opening up in Las Vegas. We decided to try it out. I called ahead looking for a cake that would be big enough to feed 10-12 people. I hoped to get the cake for my mothers birthday. When I called they told me that they had some cakes big enough to feed 10-12 people. The girl on the phone told me they had several cakes available. I paid for it over the phone. When I got there to pick up the cake I was livid. The cake I paid for was over $60, but that's what I expected coming from Las Vegas Cake Boss. But the cake they were trying to say I paid for was smaller than my hand!! Enough to feed 4 people! So the girl takes the cake to the side where another lady looks to be prepping dough for cookies. They talk for about 15 minutes. The girl comes back and tells me I have two options; one, that I can get cup cakes to put around the cake. But I have to pay $4.50 for each additional cupcake! She then tells me my second option is to cut the cake into thin pencil like slices. Seriously?! I told her I wanted the cake I ordered over the phone and paid for. She then opens her cash drawer and tells me here's your money back. That's customer service?! I am beyond frustrated. Will never be purchasing anything from this place. I highly suggest that you all try some of the better bakery shops on and off the Strip. Like Rolling in the Dough! Great service and even better desserts!",0
"Stale cupcakes with mediocre chocolate frosting. Biscotti is better from the Costco tub. Staff that was more interested in yaking with each other than providing service. Growing up in Philly with plenty of Italian bakery's . Got me once, not again.",0
Wanted to write a good review but I couldn't the line was so long!!!!!!!! Went there twice!!!! Sad I really had high expectations,0
If you want to wait in line for sub par cheesecake this is your place. It's drier then their biscotti. Cheesecake Factory (for once) a much better stop,0
"Because I enjoy watching the show on TV, I was expecting an incomparable experience when tasting the products in the store. I would have preferred the lobster tail dough to be softer however the cream filling was delicious with a touch of liqueur. The cannoli was average and I expected the cup cakes a little more moist and soft. Cheese cake flavor did not stand out from others I've tried. I liked half moon and chocolate butter cookies. I also wanted chocolate covered strawberries, but there were none for sale. I feel you are definitely paying for celebrity and not flavor",0
"Sucker punched!! The line is so misleading. It just confirms how us humans are such lemings!! We got the lobster tail (filo dough rolled around a custard filling), napoleon (filo dough layers with custard alternating layers, and two biscottis for $19!!! What there must be a mistake, you ask. No, they really are that ridiculously expensive. This should be $$$$ instead of the $$, that they were defined as in Yelp. The food tasted ok, nothing special or outstanding to justify that level of pricing. For that price, go to Payard in Caesars or Bouchon for their macaroons and choco almond croissant. I haven't tried any of their cakes but I can't afford it if the other items are any indication.",0
Extremely disappointed. Ordered three cakes and trashed two. I could get better quality dessert from any grocery store.,0
"Amazingly BAD we as many people went to Vegas to get married and when I found out we were staying at The Venetian and they has a Carlo's Bakery there I called to get a small wedding cake ordered. I asked for a small round cake all white possibly a little pink and was told no problem they just need 24 hours so if we have time just come into the bakery when we arrive and we can work with them directly. We did just this and when we arrived were tole the best they could do is a week maybe 3 days or we could pick something out of the case. We asked to see the manager and were told they were not there. So we got stuck with an ugly cake with a brown bow and orange and green dots. They asked if we wanted anything written on it we said sure Congratulations and our names on the cake and they used blood red and it ran down the side of the cake looking like it was bleeding. When we did serve the cake we had nothing but snickers from our friends, the fontdant was so driy it cracked and fell off and the cake was dense and dryer than a pound cake. Basically ir was a bad cake from a bakery that just didn't care about the product it put out. When we called to complain no one ever called back. We emailed them and after several days got a vague email saying sorry send me a copy of your receipt. Then over a week later got another email saying sorry next time your in Vegas you can have 10% off anything in the store. BIG THANKS ruin my wedding and toss me a pathetic 10% off I SAY PASS THIS BY AND GET YOUR SWEETS FOR HOSTESS THEY WILL BE BETTER",0
"I was so excited to know that there was a Carlo's Bake shop in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. So I drove 4 hours to buy a lot of goodies for my husbands birthday tomorrow. I was so excited to try there crumb cake, cannolis, and lobster tails but I was sadly disappointed!!!! The crumb cake was very dry and hard . The cannolis were ok. The lobster tails were good but the crust could have been flakier. I should have just stood with our local Portos Bakery in California they're the BEST!!!!",0
"We ordered our cake from here for our wedding. A simple cake but somehow they screwed it up. Starting with the bakery in our home state never forwarding the order to the Las Vegas location. Fortunately I called a few days before to make sure our order was good to go. After a mere 30 minutes and 3 phone calls I thought we were all set! After arriving in Vegas we picked up our cake, a few hrs later we were ready to indulge. Much to our surprise there was hardly any filling and they used the wrong frosting. I know what the cake should have been like since I paid for the tasting and experienced the exact cake we wanted. Cake boss I think not! this operation is far less than advertised, had I ordered a cake from a bakery in a supermarket I would have had better luck! It just shows that you can have a TV show where you talk like you know how to run a business but in reality you just have drama!",0
"Very poorly done and visually unattractive. I was beyond excited to hear that there was a Carlos bakery at the Venetian. We went out of our way to visit and was quickly disappointed. The long line outside the bakery was awkward as it was broken in two and cordoned by rope to make room for bathroom users. Across the way from the bakery was a Buddy's restaurant that was mostly empty. We thought to come by after dinner for a shorter line. The second time we returned, the line was slightly shorter and was creeping along slowly. The bakery itself is claustrophobic and the front display case faces to the side. You can't easily view the pastries while waiting. I took a peek inside the cases and the cakes and pastries looked average --nothing that you would expect after watching the show. We ended up ditching the bakery without buying anything and we won't return. A gigantic waste of our time. No excuse for the Venetian to build another restaurant rather than use the ample space to build the bakery as it should.",0
"Such a disappointment. We are huge cake boss fans and have been to this bakery before...as others have noted, the lines are SLOW; they always seem understaffed. Also, there are no prices posted so you just order and pay (out the nose). The worst part though, they give the illusion of things being baked fresh in the bakery next door which must be a hoax since the eclair we ordered as a part of our large family order was unmistakably FREEZER BURNT. So sad. There's no way we will be back even though some of the desserts are fabulous ($20+ options). Don't you guys taste your products for quality control? Thanks, but no thanks.",0
"I was so disappointed! After watching all of his shows for years, I was excited to find out he had a location in Vegas. The cannolis were not good. The filling was dry and left a weird feeling in your mouth. The cupcakes were like eating air, light with no flavor. The cookies were good, but can get anywhere. We bought a fondant cake and it was $50! We put in the freezer for later use but won't share with anyone because we're afraid it would be not up to par. Congrats on his success, but quality control is needed! I'll never go back!",0
"So disappointed, went to the Venetian last night excited to try some pastry's at Carlo's Bake Shop. I am a big fan of his show ""Cake Boss"", so I was expecting the sugar cookie, and chocolate cookie I ordered to taste AMAZING...first bite in the cookie crumbled into tiny pieces, half in my mouth, half on the floor. It was so dry, that it was more like powdered sugar. Total let down:(",0
"My wife is a fan of the show so we stopped by while visiting family in Vegas. While in line we asked the employee monitoring the line if lobster tails were still available because it was late and near closing. She went to check and told us that they would make some for us! Fantastic! When we made it the counter, we ordered two tails and the worker told us she would check. She asked another employee who rolled her eyes and said, ""Just tell them we are out."" She did and I explained what the other employee had said and so she went to check in the back. She came back with two tails! I forgave the bad attitude because it was late at night and I understand that the workers wanting to go home. However, the other part of our order was filled incorrectly which we did not discover until we got home. The store was closed by then so there was no way to remedy the error. The items were good, but not what we wanted. A few days later we stopped by on our way out of town and got some treats. An hour later on the interstate we opened the boxes to discover that one item had been left out of our order. It was a cookie that my seven year old wanted. (Because of the show, he wants to be a baker when he grows up.) After arriving home I called and asked for a refund for the cookie we did not receive. I was told that they could not do that and instead they offered to replace it. Great, except that I was in Boise, Idaho and could not driving back to Vegas for a cookie. I explained this and was told, ""If you don't want it, that's your choice"" and they hung up. Because of the way I was treated in person and on the phone I will not go back and I recommend that you avoid this place as well. I would give zero stars if it were possible. While the lobster tail was delicious, the other things were just okay. Poor employee attitude and lackluster customer service have killed many businesses. Unless Carlo's fixes these, this location is doomed to fail as soon as the novelty of visiting a bakery seen on TV wears off. Shame on you Buddy for allowing this to happen at your family's store.",0
Baked good just okay and the service was very poor. Customers weren't acknowledged and the staff was wandering around doing various odd jobs and talking and chatting among themselves. BIG disappointment.,0
"We purchased items here when they first opened 2 years ago. We were highly impressed with the chocolate cannoli but disappointed in the lobster tails and especially in the red velvet cupcakes, both very dry. We tried again last year. The cookies weren't all that impressive and the regular cannoli was just okay. This year, we were more than disappointed. We were looking forward to having the chocolate cannoli again. Unfortunately, they now only have them on some weekends. We ended up with a dry donut, extremely dry biscotti and an unimpressive Linzer cookie with tart and too sweet strawberry filling. They really didn't have much to offer other than cookies and cupcakes. They did have lobster tails but didn't try again since we didn't care for them the first time. They have small two-serving Bundt sized cakes for almost $10 each. Figured we'd skip them since everything we have purchased, other than the cannoli, has been dry and almost tasted day old. It's really too bad because everything on their show looks so fresh and delicious. I think Buddy needs to do a surprise visit during the week and do a surprise inspection.",0
"Don't waste your time or money here. First you have to wait in a line to order your desserts then they send you to another line to pay. Once you are waiting in line to pay they call you name you think its to pay for your order but they are just showing you your order after they have put it in the box. now you have just lost your spot in line and have to wait again for them to call your name for a 2nd time. The desserts were just OK, i have had way better. Worst of all they were extremely rude! I wanted to buy a kids shirt ,which they had on display. I asked for one and the girl just kept saying that they only had size small. I could see bins full of t-shirts. I asked if it was child's SM or adult and all she could respond with was ""its just small"". I also was talking to another woman who was waiting. she only ordered 1 pastry and was there before we got there. she was still waiting even after i paid for my order. She asked what was going on and the girl behind the counter and gave her a dirty look and said ""I called your name like 10 times and you never came up."" Her name was never called. The employee just kept telling her that she should have been listening. All around poor experience.",0
"Do not buy the bag of cookies that sells for $22. They are not fresh and not worth the money. Mine tasted like they were at least 3 days old if not more. i went there because of a recommendation on the apple pie. Since they were out of apple pies, I bought the cookies. Overall, I was not impressed. The meringue with hazelnut was horrible too.",0
"This place is living on a name only. When you go, expect a long wait in line mostly because the staff is not set up right and does not know how to process a long line. They do not have any dedicated stations for the staff. One register person and she is floating between taking orders, filling orders and checking people out. It is a mess. The food we had was mediocre at best, I have been to MUCH better Italian bakeries. I think since the boss is away ( in NJ) the mice will play and all I can say is the quality of what we ordered was not great. The only decent item was the Lobster roll but that is not enough to get me to go back here and endure the long lines.",0
Cupcakes very dry...disappointing. Was really looking forward to some good cake on my birthday!!!,0
"I was so excited to have a cupcake from Carlos bakery because on t.v they make it seem like they are the best in the whole world so I figured I would try them. I had a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate cupcake.I was quite disappointed actually. It wasn't by far any better than cupcakes at my local bakery "" Sift "".",0
"We went last week and waited in line about an hour. The employee at the front of the line only let's in a few at a time and tells you to go to the front. I walked to the front counter but that wasn't where she wanted me to go, where she wanted me to go was to the end of the counter closest to the hall where I'd just come in from, sorry but that's not the front. Once you stand there someone will come over and take your order but you can't really see everything without walking around first unless you are psychic and know what's in the cases. The small tiny one person sized dessert cakes are way overpriced at either 7.95 or 9.95 each depending on which one you got. I love cannolis but theirs was too hard and crunchy and the filling was ok nothing worth the wait. My fave cookie is the black and white and my fave place to get one is still the deli at the south point hotel, the one here just plain wasn't good. Frosting was okay but cookie itself not good. For the prices I expect much better quality. They were also giving away samples of what I was told was a butter cookie but it wasn't even close to being as good as a walkers shortbread. I took one bite and threw rest away. Ivebhad better from keebler and nabisco.I don't know if buddy has gotten to big for his britches and lost sight of quality control or if they have always been about par and perhaps the people of new jersey just never had anything good to compare it against. We've now had stuff from both locations and I still don't like it.",0
"Very dissapointed, work in the area so have walked by several times,the place always looks busy but actually its not. The counter help and cashiers are just super slow. There doesnt seem to be any real system to get the treats. I get the number system however its not working there. After my number was called and I placed my order my number was called again 15 minutes later,the guy asked what we wanted I told him we already placed an order,he started bad mouthing his co workers. Another seven minutes later our order was ready. So after waiting 22 minutes I got my cannoli and cream puff. Yup waited 22 minutes for trwo items that just had to be pulled out of the display case. The treats were ok nothing to write home about.",0
"I'm a local and live in Las Vegas but I rarely go to the strip. I was at the Venetian to do some shopping and decided to try Carlo's bake shop. I've been wanting to try some pastries from the famous bakery but that excitement was short lived when I had to wait in line for 30 minutes. When I FINALLY got to order I only got a chocolate chip and M&M cookie and a chocolate cupcake with white frosting. Sounds like a home run right? NOT! The cookie was hard and tasted like it was a couple days old. It did taste better after sitting in the car because the chocolate chips and M&MS melted but I was disappointed. The cupcake......absolutely DISGUSTING! The chocolate cake was dry and stale and didn't even taste like chocolate. The frosting tasted like shortening. I just threw the whole thing away. It's pretty difficult to mess up cookies and cupcakes but Carlo's has managed to do so. Don't waste your time or money. I'm a connoisseur of desserts, especially cookies and cupcakes but Carlo's has it ALL wrong!",0
I ordered a cake for my husbands 50th birthday 2 weeks before we flew out to Vegas and when I went to pick up the cake on the day we arrived they had no record of that order. They had no cakes available but could make me one for the next day pick up but it could not be a custom cake because they had to have 2 days pre-order. I already gave them 2 weeks!!!! The next day I picked up the very generic cake and had to sign in 2 places that basically no matter what the issue is I cannot get a refund. Now I know why they make you sign this because the cake was HORRIBLE. I thought I would be getting my husband this wonderful cake by the Buddy the Cake Boss and I have had better cakes at Costco. What a disappointment and waste of time and money. I should have ordered it from the Venetian hotel.,0
Waiting lines are too long and the employees are way too chill to take care of you. In the end the quality or the taste of the products are way below expectations. Go somewhere else.,0
"We were excited to be here. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. We waited 20 mins in line only to be told we needed to order at the case and then get in line. We along with several other guests went to order at the case only to wait another 10 mins and we got no help. No one approached us no one acknowledged us the employees were to busy chatting among one another and were more attentive to stocking the souvenirs. Several groups of guests left and as we were milling around the front one employee yells towards us ""I can help you now"" with such attitude as if she was doing me the favor. BUDDY you need to look at this team and have them take some guest service lessons....it stems from the mangement and flows downhill. If I was going to drop money on over priced desserts because of your Name. ...I'd rather not if getting treated like this",0
Carlo has good desserts. The lobster tail my husband tried and the cannoli I tried however the service is the laziest I have ever seen. Standing in line for over 20 mins and then after ordering from the slowest waitresses to then having to stand in another line while they wrap your food then wait for cashier to pay. Bad reflection on the manager to have a staff with no urgency in a city like Vegas with tons of people. I feel the service can be so much better! The ladies stand around chatting while wrapping at a slow pace. One girl held up the line waiting on tiramisu that was already in the case and she didn't know it. Sad sad service! Utter ridiculousness... Never seen anything like it,0
"If you are a TV star specializing in baked goods, you are expected to deliver great quality and unique tasting foods. This was not quality food, it did not taste unique to grocery store bought baked goods! Sorry but true! I've tasted better desserts!",0
"I've been coming here since this place opened, i'm a local and i work on the strip so this place is usually where i go to get my dessert fix. I went in, ordered cannolis and other cookies. The guy helping me didn't move around to grab my stuff this time, so i was wondering when he was going to put my desserts in the box. Then he said to go to the register and they would have my goodies in a bit. I went over to the register and the cashier said the order back to me and it was completely wrong. So i told her my actual order and she looked confused, then she rang my card. Almost 70 bucks. Later the guy comes back with my bag and one box and a horrible attitude and i said thank you and left. I get to my car, open the box and see half the items i ordered are missing. So i walk all the way back, go to the register, talk to the lady that rang me, and she once again looks super confused. She gets who seems to be her supervisor and he brings me my receipt and tells me he isn't going to charge me extra because the computer didn't charge me tax?? Then i told him that i was up there because i was missing half the stuff in my order so he goes and talks to the dude that took my order. They start gathering my stuff and then get handed my stuff with a less than pleasant attitude, he likely thought i was lying even though the first box was already full and i never got my second box for my other stuff. Anyway, I get in my car and its still the WRONG COOKIES!! I was so mad lol...So i just went home. Sorry for the rant everyone but i'm so tired of dealing with their nasty attitudes. They always look so annoyed when people order. So I won't be back, if you're looking for a good place, try Freed's Bakery :)",0
"Today we visited Carlos Bakery in the Venitian. There was a line out the bakery but we figured we would wait because we wanted to try it! First the line moves fast, then we got into the bakery and were right inside for at least 30 minutes. There were only 3 people in front of us and it took way too long. Everyone in line was upset and the employees were just taking their time and talking to each other. It was so unprofessional and we will not be going back. The employees needed to be quicker and more attentive to the guests. It was a huge disappointment. We waited in line for an hour at least and it should not have taken that long. Not to mention the beer in buddys restaurant across the hall was 10$ for one!! We are not happy customers. ALSO, when we left, we were looking to see exactly how expensive everything was and realized that the cashier charged us for 2 cookies! We only ordered one... I know it was only a 2$ cookie but still! The whole thing sucked.",0
"On a recent trip to Vegas, I was so excited to take my mother to Carlo's Bakery. I must say, we were underwhelmed, to say the least. Of the five employees working, we noted not a single smile. At best, they seemed bored and uninterested. That was disappointing. Then, there was the food. We ordered a brownie, red velvet cupcake and a cannoli. They didn't even have regular cannoli, so we got a chocolate chip cannoli. Not a single dessert impressed. They were all just average. We bought cupcakes from the grocery store bakery a few days later that we all agreed were better. Sad, sad experience. Maybe the Cake Boss has over-extended himself. . . .Is quantity having a negative impact on quality?",0
"We visited the bakery today. We went because my daughter is a fan of the show and wanted to see the bakery. We arrived at 4:00 p.m. and were told it was about an hour wait. We stood in line only because I didn't want to disappoint my daughter. It took us 45 mins to get into the bakery. I have to say, I was underwhelmed. I was expecting more of a variety. Don't get me wrong, they have cupcakes, cookies, biscotti, eclairs, a few different pastries and cannolis. No pies and a few cakes. Not to mention way OVERPRICED!! They write your order down then have you wait another 10 mins, in a very small waiting area, while they package your goodies. Very inconvenient. We purchased 4 small cannolis, 2 strawberry cheesecakes (@ 10.95 each and they are a bit larger than the cupcakes), 1 sugar dipped cookie (they sell the cookies by the pound, 22.50/lb), 1 lobster tail, 1 cupcake and 1 chocolate mousse cake ( same size as the cheesecake). The grand total? $58.37!!! I get that this is located on the strip and it's all about the almighty dollar, but I will not return. The quality of the goodies is mediocre at best, with the exception of the lobster claw. The cream filling was very good. All this really is, is the Venetian using Buddy's name but the quality is severely lacking. If this is what represents what you would get at one of the bakeries in New Jersey, I don't get the hype. It was a huge disappointment.",0
I cannot comment on the food because we did not get any. I was excited to go to Carlos Bakery (since I watch the show) but first let me start by saying it was nearly impossible and a pain to find. Then when you do find the place it is jam packed with people that you cannot even see the displays to decide what (if anything) you want to order. There were way too many people and it was chaos. Totally not worth the wait and not worth looking for when you are in Vegas. Instead we went to Ben and Jerry's at Casino Royale and ended up just as happy...or maybe even happier after I've read all these sad reviews on the place!,0
Really?? Seriously?? This is what all the hype is about? Let me just say I was very disapointed. Aside from the cannoli the desserts that I got were disgusting!! They tasted almost rancid or as if they had spoiled. I was shocked at the taste. Again the canoli was good but the red velvet cake ( Duncan Hines in a box taste better) and especislly the chocolate mouse cheesecake were rancid tasting and horrible. We ended up throwing both away barely touched. Hey Buddy here is a tip.. Before you go across the country rating other peoples bakeries for tv entertainment please take a closer look at your own establishment. I have no doubt you have the skill and probdo better than what is presented at your vegas location. I don't know who is in charge there but you need to visit and start randomly tasting. I have alot if chocolate mousse in my life and alot of cheesecake but none have tasted bitter and rancid. I am convinced a step was missed by mistake in the baking process cuz there is no way that could be considered quality or even eatable. Get it together. I am bothered because this stuff wasnt cheap. We wanted to go back and complain because again we thought it had to be a mistake but we had to catch our flight out.,0
"spent 60$ at this place and the best was the lobster tail ,the cupcakes were poor at best, dry and the buttercream was lacking to say the least , the cannoli were poor ,I was so looking forward to them ,the tart was ok but not worth going back for ,the eclairs were just poor no flavor , its assembly line has lost its home flavor, 2 stars only because of lobster tail.....sad what a waste of 60$",0
"I was very disappointed to see that the lobster tails are twice as small now. I was here two years ago and they were a great size that I didn't care paying seven dollars for it. Now they are very, very small and not worth paying almost six dollars for it at all. They were to hard, the flakes of the pastry were not crunchy, they seemed staled and I had to be careful not to poke the roof of my mouth with every bite. I am so disappointed as I am a huge fan of his show but if they continue to not care for the quality of he product I don't think It will be coming back. I am so sad, I really loved their lobster tail...",0
RUDE. just got hung up on on the phone. Called back and was not able to get a finished sentence in. If you dont want to deal with customer service then dont open a bakery. duh.,0
"As me and my wife walked through the Venetian... we discovered Carlos Bakery, Buddys bakery from the tlc channel. My wife was excited as she is a fan of his. We purchased 3 things, a chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips, a mini eclair and cannoli... it was nothing special and over priced, those 3 items cost us $11... for a tasteless, an over sweet cannoli only the pastry of it was good and a stale mini eclair... it appears this place is just name driven, no quality. Will never go back... hopefullu Buddy himself will and set the standards if his products as it doesnt belong in a tasteful and classy place such as the Venetian.",0
The Cake Boss should be ashamed of his store. The service was horrible and we never had any cake. We waited 45 mins.,0
"I don't know who taught y'all how to make a cannoli but oh goodness it's clear that no one has ever shown you how to strain ricotta cheese so that you don't have to cut it with cream cheese. For a cannoli that costs over $6, it's pathetic. Do better. Secondly, over $9 for a cake that is no bigger than a chocolate lava cake from dominos. Again, you can do better. It's absolutely shameful that you would charge that amount for that tiny piece of cake. Im not discrediting the time, effort, and cost of ingredients by any means. Pictures for comparison with a diet coke can, a butter keeper, and a McDonald's bbq sauce cup. Don't waste your money. You're better off going literally anywhere else.",0
"Very basic pastries. We were very excited to try The Cake Boss bakery but it was disappointing. As I wrote in the review about his restaurant, due to his popularity they very busy and cater to quantity rather than quality. I've been to better bakeries, don't waste your time in the long lines or your money. My SO tried a cupcake and had the cannoli cheesecake, they are gluten free so no crust, my favorite part. I will not return. Overrated:-(",0
Both cookie and cannoli hards as a rock! We used them to play drums on the box. Only exciting part or use for these horrible deserts. Not a wide selection either! So bad we refused to waste anymore money at bakery or restaurant.,0
"Too commercialized, the cakes per slice aren't fresh, they are pre packaged not sure for how long. Might as well purchase ones off the vending machines downstairs. I also thought they would have more options to choose from.they don't at this location I went to. Disappointing, might as well go to some sort of Asian bakery, or brew tea bar for a sweet treat",0
"I love the show Cake Boss and always wanted to give his treats a try. I finally had the chance too but I'm so disappointed. It didn't live up to the hype Carlo's Bakery was getting. I went during Christmas and the line was surprisingly short. I ordered a few things (4) and my total was nearly $30, so overpriced and didn't taste good. - Oreo Cupcake : 8/10, best thing I've tried. It was about $3-5? Decent flavor and moist cake but nothing special. - Chocolate Dipped cheesecake : 4/10, it was about the size of my palm and it was over $10. Very expensive for a tiny cheesecake with barely any flavorful. The thin chocolate shell was the only flavor profile, the cheesecake had no flavor and there wasn't even a crust. - Original Cannoli : 2/10, absolutely never again. The shell was hard and had a weird flavor. There was soooo much cream that also had a weird flavor. It was kinda dry and overall disappointing. - Lobster tail : 5/10, I thought it would be flakey but when it bit into it, it was hard. The cream doesn't have flavor so this wasn't worth $7. No flavor and hard.",0
There's two rude women that works here! I'll never buy from this place! If you're looking for good customer service this is not the place!,0
"Finally got the chance to try Carlo's Bakery in Las Vegas. In the past, everytime I came by there was such a long line. I would not have the patience to wait. A couple of weeks ago, there was no line and bakery cases filled with lovely looking sweets. I asked the young lady what the two most popular items were, and I bought those. She recommended the Lobster Tail and the Cannolis. Well, I was underwhelmed with both of them. I've tried these items quite a bit on the East Coast. Carlo's versions were decent, but not nearly as great as I thought they would be. Was especially disappointed with the Cannoli. It did not taste fresh at all. The shell tasted old and stale. I'd return again to try more of their goodies if there was no line. Not worth it to me to stand in a long line based on this one experience. Hoping for good results next time.",0
"Called to inform after placing a $65 order that items were missing after leaving the LV strip. Person who answered phone was incredibly rude, wouldn't tell me her name and asked repeated what she was supposed to do about it, got an attitude and then hung up on me. My purpose for calling was to inform them that it seemed someone wasn't paying attention when orders were packaged and told her that. She grunted. Being in the customer service industry myself, this response was extremely rude and unprofessional and puts Carlo's Bakery to shame.",0
It was me and my fiancÃ©s first time going to Las Vegas for New Years. One of the first things were to definitely visit Carlo's Bakery because we are big fans of the show. We bought the Cannoli Bundle that came with 5 cannoli. 4 regular and one chocolate cannoli. We also bought the slice of red velvet cake. We were so excited to finally try Carlo's Cannolis but unfortunately it did not meet our expectations. The cannoli filling had a weird texture. We expected it to be light and tasteful. It was heavy and not flavorful. The red velvet cake also did not meet our expectations. It did not taste great like we thought it would be. Unfortunately the only good thing I can say about this place was the service. Me and my fiancÃ© were so sad because we love the show but it was a disappointment to us.,0
I was very disappointed by the cookies here. It tasted like it was frozen and then reheated. They were extremely expensive (4.50-4.95 each) and not that good. I've definitely had better and will not be back.,0
Red velvet cake. Tasted terrible. Super dry. Not moist at all. Might as well get a preservative packed cake from Ralph's or your local grocery store. Leave this cake where it belongs... In a vending machine miles and miles away from anywhere near being baked fresh. Shame on Carlo...,0
"I have to say, the sun has surely set on Buddy V's pastry empire. I came here expecting amazing cannoli (what Buddy V claims is a specialty of his on TV), and what I got was a sloppy, unauthentic and repulsive mess. The filling was disgustingly sweet, while the shell was bitter and rock hard. I would expect some of the best cannoli in the world (or so Buddy V would claim) to have a subtly sweet filling and a flaky shell at the least. I got none of these things. Almost as if to mock my misfortune, Carlo's bakery charges in excess of $5 for this experience.",0
Over priced and over hyped. Bought a cookie and a strawberry cheesecake and it was $15. The cookie was so dry and the strawberry cheesecake tasted bad that I couldn't even finish it.,0
"This is the first time I'm disappointed with anything I buy here. The lobster tails were too hard & crispy, I couldn't enjoy them. I also tried the rainbow cake which was too dry & super sweet. Both these items were overpriced.",0
The rainbow cake was lame at best I've had better cake at Walmart. Cheesecake was ok. Neither was worth the price. 22.00 for the 2 pieces.,0
This place is overrated. The desserts are not that good. I got a lobster tail (stiff) and a cheesecake (flavorless). I regret paying for these overpriced desserts.,0
"Save your money and time- there are far more delicious desert places on the strip. I wanted to like it so badly but we threw away most of what we purchased. The lobster tails were so hard you could barely bite through them, the rainbow cake was mediocre and we also got a cupcake that was so so dry. It seems like the quality just isn't there and it's a shame because it could be so much better. The service was good but the process isn't efficient at all. You pick your deserts, then another line to pay, then another line to wait for your items.",0
"Ordered a 6"" strawberry short cake for my friends birthday and he loved it! My only (and biggest) issue about this bakery is their IRREGULAR BUSINESS HOURS this past weekend. Since I was visiting from out of town, I attempted to come through to order some of their infamous cannolis, twice. First time around was to pick up my pre-ordered cake. The security was telling everyone that the shop was closed even tho the workers were helping some customers inside. If I didn't place a preorder I wouldn't have had the chance to get my friends cake. I came back the next day hoping that they'd be back to their regular hours. Sadly, they haven't been open for over an hour of their posted opening nor did they leave a sign of why. It was just weird. People did line up for more than an hour in hopes to get goodies and they did - after being in line for over two hours. I couldn't do what they did coz I needed to be on the road back home... It'd be nice to try their other baked goods in the future, but that's only if they open during their posted business hours.",0
"Honestly, thanks you are cannolis! Isn't that what you're known for? Consistency was dry and hard. It was not good to say the least.",0
"It was mediocre at best. The chocolate cake tasted very dry, reminded me of a little Debbie devils food cake. We also got a vanilla cookie nothing to write home about. The sugar cookie tasted like the Christmas cookies in a tin from my childhood . We wanted to be fans but sadly no dice! I have two stars because the employees were so very nice and helpful!",0
"Good food but total rip off. I was really excited to go here after watching Cake Boss for several years, but I ended up disappointed. We ordered 2 cream lobster tails, a cookie, a cannoli cheesecake, and a slice of cake. When we opened the box about an hour later at our hotel (because the bakery is not dine-in), we only found 1 lobster tail. The rest of the food was great but it was a rip off to pay $6 extra for something we didn't even get.",0
"Disappointed with the safety measures. No markings for line control and spacing. With no markings on floor, people are invading my space and is standing too close to me! The help appeared caotic, and did not make any sense! Manager should step in and have some common sense and instruction of the workers taking orders, bagging items, and cashier. The lobster tail is my favorite although a little smaller than usual. Very disappointed w the quality and quantity of work. Do better Carlo!",0
Not happy !! Always get to order a special pie for next day pick up today the staff was rude they didn't even ask if they could just said no they don't do it.,0
Honestly save your money and time!!! Lobster tail and cannoli was really hard and not worth it! Want Italian dessert go to Eataly at MGM super good!,0
"Ehhhhh. This place is very expensive, but everyone knows that. A cannoli and lobster tail was a little under $12. The cannoli was alright. The shell was a bit hard and there was a TON of filling. Way too much. It tasted fine. The hazelnut lobster tail was nasty. I don't know what the hell that filling is, but it was so bitter. Chewing the outside was exhausting. It made my jaw hurt. I ended up throwing it away. I only gave it two stars because customer service was good. Everyone there was very friendly and prompt.",0
I got 2 cake slices from the cake vending machine-one chocolate and one red velvet. Awful cake. The chocolate was so sweet and hardly chocolate flavored even though it looks very chocolaty. I couldn't even eat half of the slice. The red velvet was barely better but the cream cheese frosting did taste ok. I was expecting a high end cake slice since he's the Cake Boss. Nope-cheap low quality. Tastes like shortening type frosting. A cake mix or grocery store would have been better. Don't waste your money.,0
"I was so stoked to come here. I got a dipped cannoli, rainbow chocolate fudge cake, crumb cake and an m&ms cookie the cakes were both the biggest disappointment, extremely dry and can't even eat the crumb cake.. just no flavor. The cannoli was alright just very bland. Spent a lot of money here and feel like a huge waste of money. I don't recommend this place. Hype is not there",0
"This was ridiculously disappointing. When I say that, I'm talking about the food because the staff was totally stellar. They were friendly and helpful and I would hire any of them to work for me if I ran a business. The food is overpriced trash. We have been buying dessert at the Bagel Cafe in Summerlin since we arrived in LV in 2019 and everything we've had there has been incredible so we assumed we were kicking excellence up a notch. My wife has loved the Cake Boss since it premiered and has been wanting to try it forever. I decided to make it happen for her for Valentine's Day this year. I went and bought her a $50 gift card and a mug to put it in when I gave it to her. She was very excited and ordered one of everything she wanted when we went back for her to redeem the card. Unfortunately, when we got home and did some sampling, the flavors of everything were off. I'm not sure how to explain it. It just didn't taste good. Our kids and us all agreed that it was bad. I'm frustrated that we wasted that money and it was such a letdown for my wife. We won't be back again",0
"After dying to visit his bakery. I'm disappointed, I feel like everything is commercialized. Looks are very much deceiving. Spent over $100 trying to taste a bit of everything it was overrated.",0
"The LV Strip strikes again with yet another celebrity chef let down... I really enjoyed the chocolate dipped strawberries! However, my caramel cupcake and lemon (shortbread) tart? Left a lot to be desired. Can you say, "" no flavor""! No butter, no moistness, no freshness... they could have come from a package on a store shelf! Nothing to make my belly smile.",0
Very mediocre...it's all just hype from the show. I was so excited to try their lobster tail after watching the show and was so disappointed. The cream inside was good but the pastry itself was so hard and dry. They were also out of half the pastries. Did I also mention that the lobster tail was $7??? Save your money and go to any other bakery than this place. I still love the show and am happy to say that I don't need to try his pastries anymore.,0
Cupcake and lemon ricotta pastry lacked flavor. Pastry crust was hard and old. Cupcake buttercream had odd taste and texture. Very disappointed.,0
"Went here today, St Josephs Day, and the staff informed me that they MEVER HEARD OF ST JOSEPHS PASTRY. Don't call yourself an Italian bakery. Your not.",0
I was looking forward to trying this bakery for a very long time! The sweets created by Buddy and his crew on their television show have always made my mouth water. What I found out here was that these two items cost $22+ and were just as flavorful as ones I could have grabbed at Whole Foods or the grocery store. They were decent but not $22 worthy.,0
"My friends daughter wanted a rainbow cake and came across Carlos Bakery with so many pics that showcased alot of that. So she ordered one from here. We were celebrating both our kids bday thats a day apart and figured for both to have similar cakes yet different and ordered from here as well. Although $50 for a small simple 6 inch bday cake was the most I ever paid for, for what you get, i figured coming from Venetian and a celebrity chef which i was told couldn't go wrong but boy was I wrong! Looks cute and pretty for the kids but thats all there is to it. The cake was no different than what I would get at a supermarket or costco, so to speak but for 3x the cost!! Its as if i could have slapped a bunch of sprinkles on it myself and add a celebrity name to it and charge others triple! Bottom line: it was dense, WAY overly sweet and dry. Last thing we need is our kids any more hyper than they already are and many trips to the dentist which will add to that cost of this cake. Quite disappointed coming from a celebrity chef named behind it. Perhaps he needs to find another sous chef or another bakery to represent as this does not look good. On the defense, perhaps its just the cake and other treats they have are better but with this costly experience that was not even close to edible, it makes us hesitate to try other things. Let say for 2 small 6in cakes....we have half the cake of each leftover and the slice we each had on our plates were half eaten was how bad it was for our whole party. No one, not one person enjoyed it. Actually, even a 4 year old didn't even care for it saying it was not soft and moist enough which is bad. So I am surprised at the crazy long line other reviewers have stated as it is over rated and overly priced for what you get. Sorry but not sorry. Thank you but no thank you.",0
I'm a big fan of the show so we were excited to try this place since we are guests here in the hotel For the weekend but we found this in our rainbow fudge cake slice. Very disappointed & disgusted. The counter clerk was not friendly at all seemed bothered when we asked a question. I probably will not make a purchase again from any of their locations but still a fan of show & buddy of course.,0
"My daughter and I were big fans of 'Cake Boss' and were excited to try this Las Vegas iteration. Buried deep within the Venetian it wasn't easy to find, but thanks to some kind hotel staff along the way we were finally able to locate the bakery across from Buddy V's namesake restaurant. The Good: - Friendly and knowledgable staff - Gorgeous-looking cakes and pastries - Good coffee. Had an iced black Americano that was spot-on The Not So Good: - No place to sit inside the bakery - Pricey! $32.00 for four pastries and a small coffee - Quality was lacking. All four pastries 'looked' legit but were all very dry. My daughter loves cupcakes and her peanut butter cupcake in particular was undersized and as dry as the Sahara. We've had supermarket cupcakes that were far superior. I had the coffee cake and though it tasted okay, again the cake itself was so dry and hard that we snapped the plastic knife trying to cut it into shareable pieces. I wish we could recommend this place, but unfortunately at these prices and at this level of quality, 'Carlo's Bakery Las Vegas' gets a hard pass from us.",0
Ordered carrot cake tasted like a box cake you get off the shelf at the supermarket really bad you could tell it had been sitting around for a while. Very dissatisfied.,0
"This place was unbelievable, not in a good way. Customer service was very poor, they had a legitimate complaint and did nothing about it instead they pointed out that all sales are final on a recipe they did not give us. We ordered a cheesecake strawberry preserve and it was old and the strawberry on top was rotted. It looked like it was a week old, the preserves on top were very stiff and crusty on the edges! Clearly had been in the case for a while.",0
My cheesecake had a giant curly hair in it and so did my replacement cheesecake. I also ordered a danish that had hair in it. Pastries were good but clear health issues. Would avoid.,0
"This little bakery had a lot of options from cake slices, cupcakes, cookies, cookie sandwiches, and unique authentic pastries. The place is bright and clean and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately, everything we sampled (two cookies and a cupcake) were lacking in flavor and were just lack luster. Because it's Vegas, we spent much more on these items than we would back home, and that was salt in the wound. There has got to be better dessert/pastry shops in Vegas!",0
"This is my first time to visit this Bakeshop bcoz one of my girlfriends raved about this place. Well, as a family who is always on the lookout for "" good pastries"" this place is very disappointing. First, it's overpriced ( it's Vegas, duh) . We ordered the cannoli,-- taste is bland, nothing special & the cream even tasted "" grainy""! We also ordered 3 different flavored croissants & I really think we were ripped off. We left it overnight for the next morning & the croissants became really hard to eat. Lastly, we also bought the apple crumble pie & tasted like we bought it from Vons/ Ralph's ! We Won't come back, not worth the money at all. But the staff is really nice-- that's for the star I gave.",0
Carlo should focus on quality His bakery in Hoboken has been around for such a long time and is delicious ( it use to be anyway ) Spent 54.00 on some lobster tails and cannoli to bring home for a treat Got home and couldn't wait to try They were disgusting !! Literally threw them out They were old and had no flavor ! Shame on you Buddy for taking advantage and profiteering from tourists !!!,0
Start off I saw the slice cakes in the vending machine in the Harrahs casino in the lobby.The cost for a slice cake is $9.00. I told my husband let's just go to the bakery so I can see the bakery myself . It's cute more selection is nice. I got myself 2 cupcakes 1 chocolate fudge and 1vanilla cupcake with white icing. That cost $7. and some change. I made a statement to the cashier wow for $7.they must be good cupcakes Smh that was the sign because he didn't even say anything. Shoot I got back to my room just to eat a stale cupcake. If you in the Las Vegas area this is not your spot unless you want high end Stale Cupcakes. That is a shame I am wondering if the slice cakes in the machine are past due date and stale too.,0
"TERRIBLE!!! I'm hoping Buddy sees this. I was so excited to try his bakery without the flight east. Everything looked awesome, but then we took a bite. We tried the rainbow cake, and I'm sorry, but I could make a better tasting frosting with my eyes closed. It was so gross. But we continued on to the ""famous lobster tail"". I didn't know it would be like eating an actual lobster tail. It was hard and EXTREMELY chewy. It truly was disgusting and inedible. Next we had the cannoli and third time the charm? I'll say it was better than the other two, but nothing I'd buy again. How did he get famous with horrible deserts? I'll never know. I'm ready for Buddy to prove me wrong.",0
"Everything was tasteless. I can't even explain how disappointed we all were. It was OK, not good, just ok, so not worth the money in my opinion. $9 for a slice of cake? Cannoli, eclair and lobster tail were mediocre. I don't understand how to describe it. It's like the didn't add any flavoring (like vanilla, almond etc) just sugar. There's no depth you just get sweet with no other flavor. I will not return.",0
"Decided to try this place again because there was no line. We got a chocolate cake donut and a Caramel Lobster Tail. The donut was dry as ****. The lobster tail would have been better if it wasn't so darn hard. It was difficult to even take a bite it was so hard. Had good flavor but I threw most of it out. $10 down the drain. Also, as we were waiting for our items to be bagged up we noticed that the kitchen was a disaster. Maybe they shouldn't have windows. Buddy, your restaurant is good but your bakery needs some serious improvement.",0
"I have watched Cake Boss for years since I am a cake decorator and baker as well. Buddy has always awed me with his creativity which made me want to try his products. I had the chance when we were at LV last week, there was no line and they had tons of pastries to choose from. But there are no sign or price as to what the items were. So it's hard to choose more so. We opted to just try the cookies, m&m and chocolate chips and a Christmas sugar cookies. Got 3 of each and 1 cheese danish. I was so surprised though that all of it rang to more than $40. The kids liked the cookies but they were like any other cookies that you can buy from bakeries that costs less. I didn't like the cheese danish because it was too sweet and the pastry itself was a bit hard, I'd prefer the ones from Panera bread. Maybe next time when I get the chance I'll try the cakes. We didn't get any at the time since we had some cakes already from another bakeshop.",0
"I am so disappointed! TV has a way of really dramatizing an experience! I've waited years to visit The Cake Boss bakery. I've been there twice in less than 10 months and both times fell FLAT! Nothing in the bakery deserves higher than 3-star. We've tried everything from the cheesecake, cake, cannoli, and cookies. Today I said let me try the dipped strawberries. The cashier ""cautioned"" me they were weighed. I asked her to remove the stems, bc they weren't edible and I lie not they were every bit of 3-4 inches long. She just stood there and shook her head ""no"". Four strawberries weighed in at nearly $13. Whoa! And they were not that great. Just average. My local Publix has some for .99 ea. THEY ARE DELICIOUS! As a special treat if you want an absolutely mouthwatering dessert GO across the hall TO BUDDY V's for the Italian Bday Cake! I think the pastry chef there needs to retrain the cooks at Carlos Bakery.",0
"Honestly I feel like I set my expectations too high for this place since I've been watching cake boss for as long as I can remember and actually eating it was such a disappointment. My mom & I were both disappointed because it's not what was expected. Anyways, they put too much egg in the pastries, especially the lobster tails, it has such a strong smell of egg & it makes you not want to finish it. The cannolis are okay, they just need to work on making the filling less grainy.",0
Hm for an italian bakery they have rly bad cannolis. I took a bite and threw it away...I got it chocolate dipped and the shell was a little soggy but fine. The filling was odd tasting like spoiled milk.... Luckily the strawberry eclair was better ! The choux pastry had a nice crisp on the outside and slight softness on the inside. The cream wasnt too sweet and strawberries tasted fresh. However for such a well-known bakery it was very subpar. I've had so many more cannolis and eclairs elsewhere that have been so much better!! Cake boss let me down ://,0
"Pretty poor! Coming from North Jersey, and being immersed in the Italian culture, the cookies from Carlo's were extraordinarily underwhelming. I've bought better Italian cookies in Publix, in Florida. Honestly, Great Value Cooke's far out-class what I purchased today at Carlo's in the Venetian. Mama would be vety, very disappointed, Buddy. What is also amazing (not really) to me is that for all the reviews here on Yelp, there isn't a comment back from the company. I guess Buddy and his gang are just too full of themselves and too rolling in dough to even care that their quality is so pathetic. Guess they believe that there are plenty of suckers born every minute. Sorry, Valastro, but you have completely tarnished your reputation as an actual quality baker - you're just another side-show charlatan. Nuthin' matters but the almighty buck, huh?",0
Been waiting 10 minutes for a coffee and an egg sandwich. There are 5 very confused and hideously inefficient people behind the counter and even fewer customers. I've never seen anything like this in my life.,0
"I read the reviews before I purchased the cake but still purchased it because it was cute. Had it delivered through Uber Eats. It was worth it to not deal with the Strip and Venetian during a pandemic. Anyway, the cake wasn't dry at all, but it wasn't good. It very much so tasted like a store-bought cake. The buttercream frosting was gritty ... like in the way that your mouth feels a little gritty after your teeth are polished but you haven't fully rinsed, yet. Without delivery, the cake is only like $36. It's not terrible, but honestly, I'd prefer my own h go one made cake or a boxed cake compared to this. It just wasn't very flavorful. That said, the cake was gorgeous and the colors were vibrant, so.... I guess that was the trade-off?",0
"When Carlo's opened several years ago it was extremely good. Good selection, great flavor. The past few years, the selection is terrible but occasionally I've found a tasty cupcake or something minor to eat. The last time the cupcake was terrible so this past week I decided on just cookies. Three different kinds of cookies from chocolate to sugar to chocolate chip to snickerdoodle.....they all tasted the same. $18.00 for four cookies and my husband and I wound up throwing most of them away. I can't believe that thiishment to go down hill the way that it has. Simply put...the only reason it stays open in my opinion is because people who visit Vegas may never go again. I've finally learned my lesson...I will never waste my money on another Carlo's item.",0
Over rated bakery do not let the hype fool you this place is trash I mean super duper trash. I got the cannolis bruh they taste like chalk and powder I mean it's super nasty and way over priced. Everything I mean everything is over priced and so trash. Do not go here please read the reviews first don't waste your money like me. This place is ass,0
"Hella expensive and it did not meet my expectations. Lol the worker tried to convince us to buy two lobster tails because as he put it ""is like a piece of heaven""... idk about him but if that was his heaven then that's pretty sad. The lobster tail looked good don't get me wrong, but the taste and texture wasn't amaze balls. The outer shell was crunchy and hard, not flaky and soft. We also got an individual strawberry cheesecake with crumbs and for the size of my palm (and I have a small palm) you pay $10 for okay cheesecake. I wouldn't mind paying if it was a GOOD pastry but I did not think this was at all worth the money.",0
"Went in to get our favorite, lobster tails. All orders are to go due to COVID so we had to find somewhere to sit and eat. We have had Carlos lobster tails a few times and look forward to eating these when we visit Vegas. My husband and I were very disappointed . They were so old and stale that each of us took 2-3 bites and we threw all three we purchased out. Not only were we disappointed but it was a waste of money. In addition, there is always a premium in Vegas. I suppose we could have walked back to ask for our money back but we were headed in the opposite direction and did not have the spare time to head back. I have to say that the staff was very pleasant and did their best to direct us to the nearest seating. Quality was seriously disappointing though.",0
"I used to always watch and love the Cake Boss show and I was so excited to learn that Carlos Bakery is open in Vegas. Rushing to get there as quickly as I can and with my anticipation to try their pastries, I took that one bite from one of their cupcakes....I was so disappointed. You could immediately taste the cannola oil they use instead of butter, and the cake itself too is dry and old, it'seven worse than the prepacked or vending machine type. So I gave another try to take a bite from one of their cannoli. Another disappointment! I wonder if Carlos' pastry chef is managing quality control or they are just catering their products to the regular mass without considering the authenticity of the real Italian Cannoli. Overall, it's just the hype that makes people get inline to try their pastries and I will never come back nor recommend Carlos Bakery.",0
"Heart broken at the taste of the pastries for $59 dollars. The covid precautions were non existent besides wearing masks, everyone was one on top of another, so disappointing.",0
If you're expecting something amazing please don't go prices are steep and the quality just isn't there. My wife wanted to try it since she's a fan of cake boss and we where both extremely disappointed,0
AMERICA!!! Save yo money. Expensive and mediocre product. Soooo overated. Cupcakes at Albertsons and Ralphs are way better than this piece of shit. Imagine that. And some pushy sales lady. Stay away. Y'all thank me later.,0
"Not Impressed. We got a wedge of pecan pie, a chocolate dipped cheesecake, a cookie and cream cupcake, and a slice of rainbow buttercream cake. The pecan pie was the only thing with good flavor. The chocolate dipped cheesecake was mediocre. The cookie and cream cupcake was a slightly dry underflavored chocolate cupcake with some gritty speckled frosting on top that tasted nothing like cookies and cream. The rainbow cake was equally flavorless and unimpressive. I'm honestly pretty upset with the inflated prices we paid for underwhelming bakery goods. Don't get lured in by the Carlos name and Buddy's face everywhere. You can get a better cake out of a box at the store for $2 and save yourself $20. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because the staff were great.",0
"We were looking for deserts to take it back to the room because we were so full after dinner and we found this place from Venetian website. Unfortunately it was not what we expected. This is the store inside Venetian. From the look, all their baking products, there was nothing impressive at all. We went ahead and got a slice of chocolate cake that ready packed in a clear plastic container and a white chocolate mousse to take it back to our room. The cake was overwhelmingly sweet like a grocery store bought cake. There was no quality into it. One would expect the store in a nice hotel like this would make high end deserts, not this one though. Go some place else if you want a high end dessert from a Michelin Chef. But if you don't mind just a piece of cake load nothing but sugar, this is for you",0
I have always wanted to try this bakery and finally but the bullet last night. I was not craving for cakes so I i tried the hazelnut cream puff and hazelnut lobster tail. Unfortunately the cream puff was stale. :( so that was a downer. However the lobster tail was good. Not great. Just good. We didn't have to wait too long in line and was checked out less than 5 mins. Two lobster tails and 1 cream puff cost us 16$(rounded up). Would i come back? Maybe for the cake. But not for the ones i have gotten last night.,0
I have ordered cupcakes from this bakery twice through DoorDash and both times I get cookies. I want a refund for both orders but they are closed. No answer by phone. DoorDash won't respond either. Every time I call this bakery they don't answer.,0
Absolutely terrible. We threw away the cookies and cupcakes we bought because they tasted so bad.,0
"Stood in line for about 7mins to place the order, then you wait for another 5-7mins when your name is called to pickup your order. There are no prices anywhere, you must ask for the prices when placing your order. Don't wait to go and pay to find out the prices are outrageous (like I did!) The cake was okay- not worth $10 for a slice. ONE SLICE. It didn't taste much different than getting a slice of cake from Vons or Walmart. Save your money and time.",0
"Food: 2 stars. Ambiance: 3 stars Service: 3 stars Tried the overrated Cannoli and we were underwhelmed. Frankly nothing looked super appetizing. I would not consider this place a fine bakery and there are much better choices within few steps away. But hey, we had to give it a try after watching many episodes of Cake Boss. Carlo was nice enough to take picture with us in his cut-out form :). Good bye...",0
"Good or not, I ordered through DoorDash and $20 of my order was NOT delivered. Called the establishment and no answer. Terrible customer service for what I paid and it's Easter Sunday",0
"Awful!!! No flavor, weird textured, super expensive!! We threw $100 worth of his crap away. Terrible!!! Blah!!!",0
Worst rip off ever! I came from WASHINGTON DC just to get a cake made for my wedding! Unfortunately the wedding got called off! But I paid a $50 deposit for my cake tasting which is supposed to go towards the cake! Well being that the wedding was called off I didn't need the cake but was told that the could get a refund when I originally agreed to even do the tasting! After visiting today I am being told that my deposit is non refundable! Thats is such a scam!,0
"This place was absolute crap. Got a stale cookie, a stale cupcake, and a mediocore cheesecake. Avoid this place like a plague I spent $20 for these 3 items.",0
"Don't even waste your time. I'm really surprised there's not more quality control. At this point Buddy and his family have a reputation to uphold and this place won't do them any favors. The staff was friendly but the pastries were terrible. Dry and flavorless. Every single thing. Rainbow cookies, chocolate chip cookies, cannoli, sfolgatelle, all of it, terrible.",0
"My family and I made a quick stop. Staff was very friendly, but the pastries were bad! I spent $80! $80! I got boxes of pastries. I was expecting something delicious and all I got were stale and HARD lobster tails, and cannolis that tasted like stale toaster strudel, the raspberry cookies tasted like any other raspberry cookie. Nothing tasted like it was freshly made.",0
"I've watched his show, so decided to stop by on my next trip to Vegas. I was really excited to try his desserts because they looked so good. I ordered the cannoli and was very disappointed. The cannoli was dry and the filling overly sweet. I would not come here again.",0
"I'm a huge fan of Cake boss! I seen the bakery and had to stop, the line was insane, but I stood in line anyway. I ordered the mini strawberry cheesecake with the crumbs for about 11 bucks, I'm sad to say that your better off going to the Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecake was bland, the strawberry on top was the best ever!",0
I was highly disappointed. The pictures look very nice. The advertising worked cause it made me walk to the Bakery and purchase a piece of the chocolate iced rainbow cake. Such a disappointment cause the cake layers are DRY. The chocolate icing was decent. But the layers were so dry that you can't pick up any of the vanilla flavor. Presentation looks good. Even in the cake vending machines at the Harrah's casino it looks good. But don't let the looks fool you. If you like dry cakes then you're in for a treat. But they won't be getting my business anymore.,0
I can't express how thoroughly disappointed I was. The cream puff my daughter ordered was significantly smaller than the one in the display. My eclair was cold. I could tell it was old because the filling separated and water was running from the filling. Next time I'll eat at home.,0
"I got the cheesecake. Not only was it not worth the money-nearly $12 for a small cheesecake, it was so dry. I couldn't get past the third bite. I was so bummed!",0
"Disappointing. I was incredibly excited to get some sweet treats from this place, I love the show and love specialty goodies like these. There were so many things to choose from - everything looked so good. My friend had a chocolate fudge cupcake and I ordered the original cannoli and seasonal cupcake. The cannoli The pastry was dry and clearly old. When I took a bite the outside crumbed off (not in a yummy flaky way) and the inside of the cannoli was chewy and gross. The filling inside was alright, it was creamy but nothing spectacular. I didn't even finish the cannoli because it was so lackluster. Since I only tried one, I can't tell if I got one of the old ones from a week before or if they are all like that. Truly disappointing. I would have expected a store bought (like walmart) cannoli to taste this terrible. The seasonal cupcake Looked delicious. Beautiful cupcake decorated in fall/autumn colors with a chocolate leaf on top. It was a vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream (colored) frosting. The cake was pretty tasty, not incredibly fresh but it wasn't old and crumbly like the cannoli. The frosting was clearly homemade. Good, right? Um, no. It tasted like straight up butter. I bake occasionally and I have had this happen to me when I used too much butter and not enough sugar. The frosting didn't even have a hint of vanilla taste to it. I'm glad it was homemade I just wish they would've put some ""Cream"" in the buttercream frosting. Yuck. My friends tried it and all felt the same way. We took the frosting off and ate the cake part. The chocolate fudge cupcake was alright. I didn't try the frosting but the cake part was the same as the seasonal cupcake (meaning it was edible). Not worth the money or time spent waiting in line. Seriously, spend $3 on a Betty Crocker cake - it's cheaper and tastes better (sadly). I'd love to go back and try other items but with three out of three misses I doubt it's worth the effort at this point. Sad face.",0
"I came here with my best friend who had always wanted to try the desserts here. The place is really cute and everything looks so good. That's where the positives stop. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and the rainbow cake. I paid 19 bucks and some change and while I wasn't too thrilled about how thin the slices were, I wasn't upset either since. When I bit into the strawberry shortcake, I was hit with this chemical-like, bitter taste. The cake was dry but would dissolve into my mouth into a sludge like consistency. I thought it was me because I was eating it in my hotel room after having dinner and assumed it was my taste buds clashing. After several bites and the flavor not getting any better, I had my best friend try my cake. She gagged. I thought that maybe they might have missed an important ingredient when making the cake so I immediately tried the rainbow cake. The batter tasted bad like the first cake and the icing tasted like the icing one makes when they mix that sugary powder that comes in a gingerbread making kit with water- not horrible but also not high end or worth the money. We tried the confetti cake my friend bought and it was the same thing. I will say, it wasn't as horrible as the cakes I ordered but still not worth the hype. I'm honestly really confused as to how this business has gotten so much positive attention when the cakes aren't edible. I'm definitely curious about the lobster tail and cannoli since that's what everyone on here has recommended. Maybe if I had gotten that, my review would be more positive. I'm definitely not willing to chance it though if I'm ever staying at the Venetian again.",0
"Only went for the cannolis but also bought cake. The consistency of the cannoli was gritty and not very flavorful. I bought 3 different cakes; carrot, rainbow and confetti! All of which taste store brought! The flavor of all three was just bland as hell. Very disappointed and overpriced. I gave two stars only because the customer service was decent.",0
worst cannoli I've ever eaten. The lobster tale creme reminded me of watery and bland.,0
"I discovered Carlo's Bake Shop sometime late last year while walking through the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian. There was a line that started at the canal and snaked its way into the alley up to the shop. Upon enquiring with a couple of folks that were lined up I found out that Carlos was the baker from the hit show ""Cake Boss"". I had watched a couple of episodes of Cake Boss but I was not such a big fan as to line up for two hour so I decided to skip it for now and try it during my next visit to Vegas, which is exactly what I did a couple of days ago. This time there was a small line of about 7-8 people before me so it seemed manageable. Even with hardly 7-8 people the line moved very slowly and I had to wait about 20 minutes for my turn. My plan was to get the Lobster tail and Cannoli as these seemed to be their most popular items, but at the very last minute I was swayed by an innocuous sign that said that our famous crumb cakes are available fresh only in the mornings. As this was morning time I checked if they had any and on learning that they were available I decided to get a lobster tail ($5.95) and a slice of the crumb cake ($4.50). After placing my order with someone behind the counter I had to wait at the cashier to collect and pay for my goods which took another couple of minutes. In all it took about 30 minutes to get two items which seemed too long. The simple way to sum up the taste would be ""humongous failure"". The crumb cake was dry and hard like a cookie. It tasted bland like they had forgotten to add a couple of ingredients to the mix. The crumbs were a little better. They were soft, chewy and very mildly sweet but were actually edible whereas the cake base was trashed after the second bite. The lobster tail fared much better that their ""famous"" crumb cake. It looked like a croissant that had a nice cream filling so I bit into it expecting a soft flaky croissant with a light, delicious cream filling. The reality was a hard shell that shattered into small pieces with each bite along with a heavy cream filling that had just a hint of sweetness. It was clear that these were targeted at the not-too-sweet crowd but I'm certain that even those that prefer their deserts less sweet will find these pastries to be extremely bland. I should have read some of the reviews on Yelp about this place which would have prevented me from wasting 30 minutes here. My experience has been that TV based super star chefs find it difficult to re-create their magic in a live environment and Carlo's Bake Shop certainly reinforced that belief. My advise to anyone who plans to visit Carlo's Bake Shop would be to take an escalator to the casino level and get some treats from Bouchon's bakery whose products you will find to be infinitely better that what you get here.",0
"If you can find this shop located in the Venetian Hotel (location kind of hidden away), it's subpar at best & greatly overpriced for what you get. I got cannolis, white chocolate covered strawberries & an M&M cookie. I'm Italian, so I know what an amazing cannoli tastes like & this was just okay. The filling had a very grainy texture but the shell was done well. The strawberries did not taste fresh & they were actually very mushy once you broke through the chocolate shell. The only reason I'll give this place 2 stars is because the cookie was good but I don't think the majority would like them. I love a crispier, crunchy cookie to a soft one, which is what I got. Customer service here was good but quick, which is understandable with their level of fame. I wouldn't go back. I would give their original East Coast location a shot because I know how Vegas an commercialize something & take away from the authenticity.",0
This place is overpriced and not very good. We ordered a small cheesecake and a chocolate covered cheesecake and a peanut butter cookie. None were great or what I expected. Especially for the huge price tag.,0
"Oh Carlo's bakery, you have lost your identity. Came in on a Saturday around noon to satisfy my east coast cravings and there were NO BLACK AND WHITE COOKIES, LOBSTER TAILS or TIRAMISU! Originally came in looking for rainbow cookies and ended up leaving highly dissatisfied. Dense and stale, no flavor whatsoever. This place is a sad excuse for a bakery that has simple treats that you can find anywhere else. A major disappointment and just another west coast bakery charging premium prices for average cannolis and fresh baked sugar cookies. I didn't come here for the name, I came here for the classic baked goods. You go in with high hopes of an Italian east coast bakery and leave feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.",0
"Definitely not worth the 30 minutes wait. I was super excited to try Carlos bake good due to all the cake boss shows I've watched for years. The pastry itself was dry and not something that was ""wow"". It's just nice to say, ""oh I ate at Carlos bakery""",0
We bought cupcakes from the bakery in Vegas twice and both times they where stale and old no freshness at all . Every time I have come to Vegas and bought a cupcake it's been like that . Not worth the price for old cupcakes .,0
"This place was difficult to find. GPS was a monster and had us walking around for about an hour. We used both an iPhone and a Samsung to map this and it was super confusing on both, and no one who worked at the hotels seemed to know where it was. These pastries were expensive. When we got back to our room it was clear they had not been refrigerated, which is fine for cookies but I am fairly certain that buttercream should be refrigerated. The cake tasted ok but not great. I put my cake in the room's fridge and ate it the next day. It tasted better cold, but there was still the issue of it not being refrigerated in the first place. The cake was fairly bland. I got the rainbow cake and felt like it could have had more flavor. But it tasted like basic white cake and food coloring. For the amount of time it took us to find this place, and for around $8 for one slice, it should have tasted more exciting. I bought my son a cookie, sugar cookie with sprinkles. It was $3. Which was the least expensive thing there. But I've purchased the same type of cookie at a Mexican bakery for 50¢, super I wasn't thrilled about spending so much money on a child's cookie, but prices weren't clearly visible and there is pressure to order quickly. My friend ordered a cup of milk. She got about 8 oz or milk. They charged her about $3. Which is more than the price for a gallon of milk. They also gave her milk that was sitting on the counter (God only knows how long it was unrefrigerated), the last bit from the jug, and mixed it with a new jug of milk. This probably only creeps me out to mix milk, but I thought I would add it since I am on a roll. As someone who worked in food service for years I think many of their non refrigeration practices are kinda gross and a potential health hazard. I wasn't impressed with this place at all",0
"Buddy, for ffs, extricate your head from your ass and fix this place up! Have spent around $75.00 per visit at this location for the past three years based upon the Lobster Tail pastry being excellent and then rounding it out with some dark chocolate mousse cake and maybe some cannoli, even though they sort of suck compared to anything I ever had on the East coast. So, picked up four Lobster Tails, a hazlenut Lobster Tail, a dark chocolate mousse cake and a chocolate mousse cheesecake for my wife on 1/20/17. This was gonna be epic! Except, the Lobster tails were flat....as in the puff pastry never puffed....nasty, chewy, awful pastry experience. If this was my pastry shop, whoever ran the product that day would disappear in the desert, or at least be fired, depending upon how passionate the proprietor was about quality product, but hey, what do I care? I got a ""free"" Carlo's Bakery water bottle because I spent enough......areyoukiddinme? Very sad, but was informed by the recipients that the dark chocolate mousse cake was still delicious.....in a previous experience, the Lobster Tail was one of the top five pastries I have ever had in life, growing up on the East coast, that is a bold statement, and I own it, but not with this one, it was total crap and expensive. Buddy? Come on....wake up and own it or close it up and move on!!!!!",0
"Hey Buddy... F You! When you charge $11 for a tiny slice of cheesecake you better be giving people the best cheesecake they had in their lives. That ship was the consistency of cottage cheese flavored like lemon. The cannoli barely had five or six chocolate chips in it, you cheap bastard. Save your money and go get anything from the supermarket at least that way they don't laugh behind your back as you're walking out.",0
"Worst cheesecake I've ever had in my life, texture was horrible and tasted even worse.",0
"I was super excited to try Carlo's bakery. I've been a fan for a long time and everything looks so good. I ordered 4 cannolis, 2 lobster tails (I only got 1) and a box of sprinkle cookies. I payed $50 something to have one missing from my box. Pastries were nothing special and pricey. Definitely not a place I would recommend or go back to. Not worth my money.",0
DISSAPOINTED. I hate to give one of my favorite tv stars a negative review but the hype isn't what it seems. The pastries are way over priced and you can get better deserts at your local grocery store for the fraction of the price. Their open baking viewing area was in disarray and the set up of the pastries was unappealing. Save your money,0
"Don't get the big deal. The almond croissant bore no resemblance to a croissant. Was a doughy undercooked chunk of bread loaded w overwhelming almond paste. Are fans of the tv show really thinking this is what an almond croissant is? The cupcake was good, and the dark chocolate mousse tart was ok. Very sweet. Only reason to come here was the cannoli which was excellent.",0
"Upon seeing this place on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Vegas.com</a> and reading the positive reviews, I went in and bought a strawberry shortcake, Boston creme, a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting, and two cust cream puffs without even thinking twice. Big mistake!!! It took me a great deal of effort to finish the shortcake, I really had to push myself hard to make it halfway though with the Boston creme, and I took a bite (and regretted immediately) from the cupcake to include it in my review. I haven't tried the cream puffs yet because I am so very disgusted. I am not going to write how horrible each of them tasted. Feel free to see it for yourself!!! Skip this place!!! Turn around and run! Really! The local family-run bakery back at home does a way better job than this and charges half the price. I wasted $27.36 here... Money down the drain. This place is a sorry excuse for a bakery. UPDATE: I went back minutes after posting this review and asked the manager to read the review. She didn't read it to the end (shows how much she paid attention) and asked me to describe how they tasted. I did and asked if there was a refund. Of course there wasn't. So I left the cream puffs for THEM to enjoy and left. Please see picture. I am going home to throw up.",0
"Don't waste your money. Just pick up some prepackaged stuff from a grocery store and you'll be better off. Ordered a brownie, a white and a dark chocolate mousse, and a Cookies & Cream Cake Slice. Nothing bad about the mouse, nothing great. The cake slice could have easily been one thawed from the frozen section of a supermarket. The brownie was much worse than things I picked up in a grocery store for half the price; stale and flavorless aside from the whole pecans throughout. Pair that with the fact that their partnership with DoorDash as a delivery service took over 90mins to give us a ""40min"" delivery (to deliver to a hotel less than 1.5 miles away); simply awful. Calls to the store meet an automated message saying they have left for the day (while well within business hours). Worst $50 ever spent!!",0
"well known for their cakes and pastries, but what s disappointing experience. The line was long and just when you reach to make your order; they get your order completely wrong. It was too long of a line plus too long on waiting for my order. Everything was sealed and package nicely, but to my horror it was not what I had ordered. Very disappointed that I could not taste what I had wanted.",0
"Every time I walked through the Venetian, I noticed a long line of people in front of Carlo's Bakery. I finally decided to see what the rave was all about. I sampled 3 items: a cannoli, an eclair, and a brownie cookie. The cream inside the cannoli tasted creamy and delicious. The cold cream surprised me and had a muted, sweet taste. The shell had an excellent flakiness to it. I had some trouble with the eclair because the chocolate frosting was stuck to the wax paper wrapping. It was very messy to eat thereafter. The brownie cookie was over-baked and hard. Unfortunately, I was heavily disappointed since Buddy Valastro is so popular. The workers seemed unhappy, weary, and unfriendly. The line was moving extremely slow and the prices were too high. I do not recommend coming here.",0
"Oh man! Disappointed. We ordered the white cake with fudge icing and it had no flavor. The chocolate icing didn't taste like chocolate at all. The outside of the bakery smelled so wonderful, but I don't think that wonderful smell was the cake. We wouldn't go back here again most likely.",0
"After watching The tv show we finally had to see what all the fuss is about. While we enjoyed our desert, the line up was obnoxiously long for on the only reason of a very poor system from the ordering to the purchasing process. Taking upwards of 45mins for no more then 20ppl to Grab and Go their orders. The displays looked nice but nothing is labeled nor has pricing also causing every customer to ask a 100 questions to find the right baked good for them. While everything comes neatly packaged. This process takes so long to wrap all the goods. For two mini cakes and 2 eclares it was 29.94$ which even for Vegas is way over priced. my time and my bank account would like a refund I do not feel these baked goods are superior to any other bakery that I never have to stand in line for. Its very unfortunate.",0
"This place is a joke! We ordered almost all their popular pastries lobster tail, canoli, rainbow cake, cup cakes and chocolate cake. Spending more than hundred dollars only to find out that the pastries being sold at local grocery stores taste better than this. I think their pastries are over priced! Their icing in the cakes are really really sweet just like the cakes in the grocery store. Canoli is not that good the crust is so hard and taste blunt not creamy. Lobster tail is ok, the inside is creamy. I don't know why people are lining up for this. Not worth it...waste of money!!!",0
Whenever I come to Vegas I stop by to buy cupcakes but this time the employee Margarita was so rude when she attended me and I told the cashier and she said she is a new employee and she doesn't know and I preferred to keep quiet. How sad that a place that is sweet the employees are so rude Buddy I was disappointed in the customer service.,0
"I make it a point to visit this place before leaving Vegas. This would be my last visit to this place. Off the bat, the worker (girl with the braided hair) was so rude. I get it - you hate your job - but really? If I ask a question about a canoli, I don't need it with a rude undertone and eye roll. Believe what everyone says about the pastries - they're waxy and taste a day old. The only thing I can recommend is the 7 layer cookies; they were very good. Ordered 2 lobster tails, 2 eclairs, 2 canoli, 4 pecan powdered balls, 2 layer cookies, a box of sugar cookies, a carrot cupcake, and and 3 cream puffs - $60 worth (there were 3 of us ordering). The promotion was spend $30 - get a free water bottle, $50 - get a free apron. When my order was ready, I asked if I can get the water bottle and the cashier said that wasn't allowed. I asked if he can do split orders and said that also wasn't allowed. I won't be coming back. The service has gone downhill. The pastries aren't that great and they're very pricey.",0
"I ordered a slice of carrot cake for my birthday (March 5) two weeks in advance & while they had the slice ready for me when I arrived, it was the worst carrot cake I have ever had. The cake was super dry & fell apart easily. Very disappointing!",0
"This place is an overpriced mess. The items look great, but no flavor, dry and mass produced and just terribly disappointing. There was a long line when we got there- which didn't detour us as because we can wait for good treats. But then $50 later, sadly NOTHING was worth more than two bites. We tried several items and ALL disappointing. I'm sad about time wasted. Sad about empty flavorless calories. Mostly sad about being tricked out of $50 by this ""famous"" bakery that produces this junk.",0
"We went to Carlos bakery to buy some and they have a promo if you spend $20 or more you get a free cookie. We spend around $25 and we showed them the promo on my phone and the salesperson called the supervisor and she ask a lot of question about where we got the promo and they need other proof so I said just forget about it, Carlos bakery is so big that one cookie matters so much to them. Carlos bakery was just overhype there product were not that good anyway. Don't advertised a promo if you are not going to honor it. Shame on Carlos bakery.",0
"I was SO excited to FINALLY get to try something from Carlo's! I have been a fan of Cake Boss for as long as I can remember and was always SO jealous of the constant line of people that got to go and try it out. Everything always looks so good! I was in Las Vegas this past weekend and remembered they opened one there inside the Venetian! I couldn't wait! I had to try a cannoli! The rest of the items I just picked out as I saw them. I purchased 4 items and it was just under $18! I didn't care about the price at that point. Here is what we got and what we thought of it... Cannoli- Honestly, I think the cannoli was the best one I've tasted so far. I don't get them a lot, but this one was good! Hazelnut Cream Puff- Nope! This one ended up in the trash unfortunately. It was disgusting. I hate to say it, but it tasted like disappointment. It had a very strange taste to it and the hazelnut was very faint and subtle. That was a waste of money. Vanilla Cupcake- I always find cupcakes made at fancy bakery's to be completely gross. I don't know what it is but they seem to taste like wallpaper glue and people LOVE them! I don't get it. This was no different. I can't really describe what it tasted like, but it was not what cake/frosting should taste like. Salted Caramel Eclair- This one was for a friend so I didn't get to taste it, but he said it was ""just ok"". Overall I was disappointed and felt like I could take that $18 and throw it in the trash. I'm glad I finally got to try it, but will not return again. I hate to say it but store bought cupcakes are better than Buddy's. Maybe New York taste is different than here on the West coast because they have been in business for so long, but I didn't care for any of it. We have a grocery store chain here that used to carry a few of his cakes. They were shipped in. I remember buying one and not liking it then, but I was really hoping that buying fresh from the bakery itself would be different. I know it's hard to pass up trying for yourself. I wouldn't have, but trust me, save yourself the money on this one. Such a bummer.",0
I've been a fan of Carlo because of his show Cake Boss so I was pretty excited to try his pastries out in Vegas. It is located inside of the Venetian across from his restaurant. We got there on a Saturday night around 10 PM and there was only a small line so the wait was not too bad. I would recommend not coming during this time because they were out of the two things I really wanted to try and their most popular items (Lobster Tail and Canoli). The selection was pretty limited at this time so I only got a California Cheesecake. I order/paid and then had to wait about 10 minutes to pickup my order. I didn't really understand this because all they have to do is box the Cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was alight but definitely not worth the price ($11) at all. I might come back to try the lobster tail and canolis but was not wowed at all by my first experience here.,0
"Was in Las Vegas for a Tournament and had a fancy dinner planned at Delmonico's at the Venetian. 3 of our friends had birthdays in the past couple of weeks and we decided to go out and purchase birthday cakes to celebrate. The original plan was to grab an Uber and go find a supermarket and grab a couple of birthday cakes when one of my buddies suggested I go to the Venetian Mall to Carlos's Bakery as it was ""famous"" for having amazing cakes. This would actually save me the time of hailing an Uber and traveling as it was in the same hotel as the restaurant!! What a grand idea....I thought. So I went to Carlo's Bakery waited almost 30 minutes, which I was ok with especially thinking about how good the cakes were going to be. I purchased 2 twelve inch birthday cakes one with chocolate and one with vanilla had the names placed on the top bought some candles and away I went! I delivered them to the restaurant in anticipation of our feast that night. Now we come into the restaurant and the meal is nothing short of amazing as it is Delmonico's!! Time for desert and I am so excited for my friends to try these amazing cakes that I found and personally carried (gingerly) all the way here. The cakes were a total bust disappointment. Dry, stale and just not very good at all, Not what I expected from a $35 small cake. I expected Nirvana & complete bliss from my taste buds. I called the bakery the next day to say we didn't eat the cakes as they were stale dry and the frosting was old and not fresh, not only did we not eat the cakes but the waiter also passed on taking the left overs home. Not what I expected for $70. I held and spoke to the manager and she put me on hold for some more, finally she comes back on and states this was not our fault obviously the restaurant got the cake form you at noontime for your 6 o'clock dinner then froze the cake then unfroze the cake and then served it to you. But what I can do for you is to offer you a 15% discount the next time we bend you over and sell you stale cake for $70.00 wasn't that kind of her? I was a huge fan of the show of the product of it all that is right until I tried the product. Not so impressed anymore. You can keep my $70 I will make sure to tell 70 people this story. Eric S.",0
"We were excited to come check it out being Cake Boss fans and all. We were staying at the Palazzo. I have to say we were very disappointed. It's super expensive and the pastries were not good at all. We bought a leclare, cupcake sized cheesecake and of course the cannoli. They were dry, cold, tasteless and too hard. Too bad won't be shopping there to say the least. I'd rather pay $27 for a nice meal!",0
"Fugetaboutit... From an Italian and former New Yorker, this place is very overrated. Rainbow cookie was stale with a smear of raspberry jam in it. Save your money. Don't believe the hype and be a sucker for the old ""he's got a show on TLC"" jig.",0
Had much more expectation from bakery by Cake Boss guy. But sub par chocolate cake and cheese cake. Cookie was OK. The not so known bakery from Mirage across the street was way better then Carlo's. Avoid it if possible.,0
"I was honestly disappointed. Maybe I set my expectations high because it's Buddy, but the pastries were expensive. I got the strawberry cheesecake and lobster tail and they were ok. The lobster tail was hard and crunchy. While the strawberry cheesecake tasted like the ones that you buy at the grocery store.",0
"C'mon, it's the CAKE BOSS!!! That AUTOMATICALLY leads to high expectations! One of the few shows our family watched together cuz Buddy and Crew are FUNNY and had some good family fun and creativity! So, we just HAD TO sink our chops into the yummies offered at their shop in The Venetian, despite the overwhelming negative reviews on yelp. It's THE CAKE BOSS!!! Could it REALLY be THAT bad?!?! It's actually a challenge to find it for first timers. It's in its own alcove right across from Buddy's Ristorante, NOT in the main area of The Shops At The Venetian, but rather at the Las Vegas Blvd. entrance on The Palazzo side, next level up from street level. We came on a Saturday early afternoon and it took 27min to get out of the line and into the bakery, then 21 min to walk out with the goods. GEEZO!!! Longest time I've ever spent in a bakery. We indulged our sweet tooths to a few things. The LOBSTER TAIL? Yummy! Nicely crunchy & flaky with a perfect amount of cream filling. The Large CANNOLI and Large CHOCOLATE-COVERED CANNOLI? Unfortunately, this specialty item was disappointing. The shell didn't taste crispy fresh, the filling wasn't as creamy as I've had and a little too sweet. The chocolate covering masked the staleness of the cannoli shell, so I liked that one better. The RED VELVET CUPCAKE? Sadly, I've had better here,too. Tasted a few days old, and not very moist. So, it took forever to complete ""the process."" We interacted with our order taker THREE times, once to take our order, once to show us what she put in the box, then finally to pay for it. 21 min. to get already made goods?!?! Way too long. Most of what we ordered we've had better quality elsewhere, AND we paid a pretty penny for almost nothing worth the cost. Buddy, ya let us down :(",0
"I can understand this place is hyped up because the guy has his own show, etc... But the ordering and payment process is ridiculous. So unorganized. Even if your items are boxed and ready to go, there's a 5 minute wait (at least) to pay. $10 for a mini cheesecake. Meh. There are much better places to go on the strip. Save your time and money.",0
"If you are looking for baked goods similar to your local grocery chain look no further. Service is excellent and the staff all helpful with recommendations and attentiveness. I appreciate the care all the staff give to patrons, but unfortunately I didn't stop by for the service, rather the food. The croissants are not worth the space they occupy in the belly. I tried both regular and almond, both bland, boring and unsatisfying. I left disappointed and waited the following day to hit Bouchon for a tasty almond croissant. If Bouchon is open, I'd suggest going there for pastries.",0
Out of all the places we ate this one was the biggest disappointment because everyone hyped it up. I had never tried a cannoli and I am keto so for this trip I was breaking keto to try a cannoli we ordered a box that had two kinds of cannolis a lobster tail a cookie and a piece of rainbow cake only the cookie was edible the rest was hard and stale I expected the cannoli to be creamy and delicious it was not and the worst was the lobster tail it tasted really bitter like bad oil.,0
"We were very dissatisfied with the quality of the food/desserts we got from here. We were super excited to go to the ""Cake Boss's"" bakery but quickly became disappointed. We all got one of the famous cannolis but found the filling to be a little gritty and not very flavorful. The cannoli also left a greasy film in your mouth. I got the carrot cake and my friend got the strawberry shortcake. Both of our cakes were really dry and the only thing we ate was some of the icing and whipped cream. I would definitely not recommend this place. Save your money and go elsewhere.",0
"I've been here a few times and for some reason always hope it will improve. I love Cake Boss and admire Buddy and his team's attention to detail and love for baking, but this bakery is a huge disappointment. I'm sure the original in Hoboken is incredible but don't waste your time here. The cakes on display aren't impressive and look like anyone made them at home. The cupcakes are extremely dry and none of the pastries look fresh. There are two lines: one to order and one to pay and both are extremely unorganized. I just went yesterday for the first time in two years and realized it hadn't gotten any better. Hopefully they will eventually improve to the standard of what viewers expect when coming to this renowned bakery. Until then, I won't be back.",0
"It didn't live up to the hype. I purchased a cupcake and a brownie. Neither item was something that I would go back for. The place was super crowded so I guess others disagree, but I definitely think you can skip this during your trip. There's another bakery in the Venetian that I will try next time.",0
"What a disappointment! We had dinner in the Venetian and did some walking around and shopping. I always develop a sweet tooth after dinner, we saw the Carlos Bake Shop sign and knew that was our next stop. It was across from Buddy V's Restaurant. The bake shop had a steady flow of customers. Even though it was late there was still a decent selection in the cases. We decided to get Vanilla cupcakes and a Creme Puff. The prices are pretty much on par with most cupcake shops/bakeries in town. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The Creme Puff was very small and pretty average tasting, had more whipped creme in than Bavarian creme. On to the cupcakes. Ugh! I have never refused to finish my cupcake until now! I LOVE cake, but this was horrible. Super dry with no taste, did they forget to add the vanilla?? If a baker can't make a plain vanilla cake then you have no business being a baker. The icing was pretty average but didn't help the cupcake one bit. The other factors in this visit saved them from getting a 1 STAR review. Skip this place if you are craving cake!! I will never go back.",0
I'm a big fan of CAKE BOSS so going to the bakery was a must!!! I was dissapointed. The lobster tail was meh and the canoli wasn't very tasty. The chocolate cupcake was also not very good. I rather make my own ghiradelli boxed cup cakes at home. :(,0
"Update: To gain a better understanding of why the baked goods we purchased at Carlo's Bake Shop were stale and dried out, I visited this shop again, just a few minutes before they closed for the evening, to confirm my understanding of their business practices. Lo and behold, at closing time, the shelves in Carlo's Bake Shop were nearly full of baked goods that had not been sold off that day, and there was no ""closing time"" discount as is the practice at other fine, fresh bakeries. As the shop closed, items were still being sold at full price - and as they closed the doors for the evening, the shelves were left full of items to dry out over night and lose their fresh taste and texture! Shame on the owners of this establishment for permitting day-old items to be sold the next day to unsuspecting customers! Given the exorbitant prices charged at this property, isn't it reasonable to assume that one is buying goods that were baked fresh the same day? Fine bakeries treat goods left overnight as ""day old"" - if these items are not sold off at a discount before closing, or simply discarded, they remove those goods from their main shelves to be sold on special discount shelves elsewhere in the shop. No such practice is used at Carlo's Bake Shop, where you are provided a selection of old items mixed in with new, and it's the luck-of-the-draw whether you are getting a fresh item when you shop here. As for the many five-star reviews listed here, a charitable explanation would be that these are customers who don't know any better. But I find it hard to believe so many of these reviewers have never been in a fine French bakery that only sells fresh-baked goods. It's not as if there aren't a number of fresh bakeries in the Las Vegas area (and in many other cities), so I'm baffled by the large number of positive reviews for this shop. Still not recommended.",0
Disappointed dry cheese cake Walmart has better deals plus it was 13 bucks I can't believe it after watching the show thought this place would be amazing I guess they just going for looks not taste don't eat here not worth it,0
"The line is ridiculous. The cannolis were already filled so it wasn't as crunchy/crispy as I would want them to be but at least it wasn't soggy? I expected more from the lobster tail since I got them right as they ""came out"" but, I guess that's what I get for not visiting the Hoboken location...? The cheesecakes were meh. Thought they could have been better. I was pretty disappointed. I watched all 7 season of Cake Boss just to be this disappointed.. so sad. But if you want to try it out for yourself, it's in the Venetian hotel near the shoppes. I always got lost trying to find this place but finally got there and was just sad. I think they close later than most stores so I guess you can head over after dinner for some overpriced dessert(s).",0
"Omg, this was the worst cupcake I've ever had, it was dry and crumby like powder. It must have been DAYS old. Shame on Carlos for his lack of attention of this bakery. Gordon Ramsey would not have put up with serving crap.",0
Worst sfogliatelle I have ever had; they are way too thick with little filling .. and are outrageously priced. Better get them at Siena's Trattoria,0
"This places is really hard to find. The cannoli was just okay. But the vanilla bean blender was really good. Do think it over priced for a cannoli, smoothie, and a smalL coffee $19.40 . Guess you paying for the name.",0
I've watched Cake Boss for YEARS Been a fan for a long time- so naturally anytime I'm in Vegas (or any city that has a Carlo's Bakery) I stop in for some goodies.. I usually get a few lobster tails because they are to die for. But this last trip I got 2 lobster tails and a slice of the rainbow cake- SO disappointed- the lobster tail had shrunk in size dramatically and it was still frozen in the middle and tasted freezer burnt as well. The cake was so flavorless and dull- the texture isn't even that good. All in all- I'm just disappointed.,0
"Granted we arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and granted we expected there to be a wait....but oh boy, was there a wait!! We were number 71 and they were only on 40. We got lucky soon after when someone gave us their number 57! (They had had enough and said, ""that's it, we're outta here!"") So from 40 to 57 was an hour. Ok we waited, no biggie. A few points: --the place is small and it's so crowded that you will not be able to look at any display cases without pushing/shoving your way to the front. --there is bar next store where you can get a cocktail while you are waiting although not sure if you would be able to hear them calling numbers. --the cake itself was a grocery store cake for all intents and purposes--good, but nothing special whatsoever and definitely not worth an hour plus wait in chaos. --the cake was $28, which is well above grocery store prices, but cheap in comparison to real authentic bakeries. We gave into the gimmick and glad we did. It's a new Vegas sight--not a must have in terms of cake, but put it on the list in case you are ever there with kids. It's now checked off the list--one and done.",0
"I'v been watching Cake Boss for years now and after my experiences at Carlo's Bake Shop I have come to the conclusion that Buddy and the Bakery is a case of a TV show making things look way better than they actually are. One thing I noticed from the show is that Buddy excels at making Cakes LOOK amazing but have you noticed everything is produced from sheet cake? There's no real skill at baking a sheet cake, even my 4 year old Niece can do that. Visiting on a Tuesday evening the Bakery wasn't as busy as I expected so if you don't want to wait long this is the time to come! The ordering system is all over the place and there are three, yes THREE lines for the whole ordering process: 1. Line to get into the Shop. 2. Line to order. You're then stood awkwardly hanging around the till to have your name called to check your order is correct before then waiting again to have your name called again. 3. Line to pay. The items myself and my Sister In Law ordered were extremely underwhelming. - Caramel Cupcake (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#z99RKrkzTHMyAvPytNK2Pg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/carl¦</a>). Cupcake was dry and there was barely any Caramel flavor. The sponge itself was Vanilla with a lightly Caramel flavored whipped Cream Frosting and a blob of Chocolate. - Caramel Pecan Cookie (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#UMNG2Ovvk7h25q7uIl723w"">yelp.com/biz_photos/carl¦</a>) Crumbly, Sweet, Buttery. My favorite of the items I got. - Jelly filled Cookie (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#QRUgV7htWb05IsFC77sHdg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/carl¦</a>). Tasteless, dry. My Sister In Law didn't like the items she got either - Chocolate Cupcake and Chocolate Brownie. She said that the Cupcake went in the trash after 2 bites and the Brownies I made her just a few days before we ''a million times better''. Sorry Buddy, just not feeling this.",0
"Ugh! This was so disappointing! For someone to be the boss of all cakes, you'd think the cake would blow your mind, or at the absolute least, be some of the better cake you've ever tasted. Unfortunately that is not the case. My sister and I both got to-go items from here after a late night dinner at Buddy V's at the Venetian. We took them back to our hotel. I opted for the funfetti cake. It ended up being too late to eat mine and I don't like cold cake anyways (they refrigerate their cake which I get why they do it, but I prefer it be room temperature when I dine on it). I ended up eating it the next night and I took the first bite and must have made a face because my sister said ""what's wrong?"" and I said ""Hmmm nothing... this just tastes like boxed cake. It's not really that good at all."" I mean really, I can name NUMEROUS bakeries in Columbus, Oh (including our grocery store bakery, Giant Eagle) that are better than this place. I would say the cake part tasted like boxed funfetti cake and the frosting tasted cheaper than canned icing. So all in all, I think I'd actually prefer Pillsbury and would label it a tad better than this cake. I can't say for sure if the cake in their Hoboken location would be better, but I think it's safe to assume they'd use all the same ingredients because it's the same ownership. After this visit, I am wondering if the Cake Boss only became famous for his presentation of cakes, and not the actual taste. Anyways, main positive about this place is the line management. We were there so late on a Sunday that there wasn't much of a line, but there is someone waiting right there with an Ipad helping you out as soon as you walk in. Friendly, helpful staff. Anyways, I'd recommend passing on this. Take a walk down to The Linq and opt for a Sprinkles cupcake instead...",0
"Everyone comes here because it's Cake Boss. I'm sorry to say that my friend and I were part of those who got suckered into coming here. The shop is small and understaffed. Grabbed a number to order. 30+ minute wait. We couldn't even see what there's to order since the shop was like packed sardines with people pushed up against the displays. Finally it was our turn. The staff took down our order. Then more waiting. Order had to be packed and placed in queue at the one-person register. Then more waiting for our names to be called so we can pay. We spent 60+ minutes to get our order. Verdict? Not worth it. The pastries were ordinary if not subpar. For the wait and price, again, not worth it.",0
Extremely underwhelmed. The bakery is down a hall where there is only another restaurant. It is small and really nothing to look at. The icing on my cupcake was hard and the sponge was very dry. My friends cookie with sprinkles was dry & hard. Neither bakery item tasted good nor was it fresh in my opinion. Sorry to say a major letdown this place was. Now I see why Buddy was a sore loser when he lost a challenge to Duff Goldman.,0
"Customer service was on point! 2 stars because of the fact I spent $35 on mediocre bakery treats. It's an unwritten rule in my book, if it's seen on TV, 9/10 times it is not nearly as good. The treats were not bad, don't get me wrong. But for $35, I'd rather support an awesome local bakery !",0
"The family and I took a trip to Vegas and we stumbled across this at the Venetian. I was giddy with excitement. I've been a huge fan of the show and have always wanted to try it! Save your money and and don't go here! This place was garbage!! I got a canolli and it was tasteless. My daughter got a piece of rainbow cake and she was so excited! She literally took one bite and I could tell she hated it. I tried it and it was tasteless and dry. My son got a brownie and while I didn't try it, he said it was good. Funny cause I ended up finding more than half of it shoved in a bag when we got back into our hotel room. Employees were nice and coffee was ok.. that's about it! Super upsetting because lord knows it isn't cheap!",0
"I had quite high expectations for this place because my mom and I always watched his show, every single episode! I was excited to find out that there was one in Vegas and we were visiting soon. I told my fiancÃ© all the great things about this place that they would have from watching the show. We got there and there was a small short line. The taking order lines and paying lines are separate and they're both not the greatest and should be reorganized again. There was no number or anything it's more of whoever the worker sees first they will ask them what they want. You'll then proceed to tell them what you want and they'll take your name down. They will then tell you to go to the back of the other line until it's your turn to pay, when you're called to. We got the regular cannoli and chocolate dipped ones(being that on the show it's always talked about one of the best sellers at the bakery). We also got a strawberry shortcake parfait or something, I don't know exactly because the employees did not know themselves what it was called. There was also barely any labels for the items so you just point and they have to follow your finger to figure out what you want because nobody knows the names of things or what some items are called. The displays of pastries were definitely pretty and well put together but it wasn't full. Half the pastry display was emptied and it was a little after 1pm. We placed our orders and went to the other line and waited until they called us to pay. Odd... Well we waited and waited. 15 minutes later when everyone ahead of us left and new people were behind us still not called. My fiancÃ© went to ask and all we got was ""oh what is your name?"" We told them and they said they couldn't find it, then asked if we forgot to order. No! We flagged the girl down who took our order and asked for his name. She replies ""oh here it is I just forgot your name"". No apologies, no nothing. Received an over priced(not a big deal since we expect to be paying over priced) box full of pastries/dessert that was half melted. We asked if we could get a fresh one since things were half melted sitting there when they forgot our names and didn't bother to ask again until we came up to them. They just said no sorry and we were on our way. Well I was excited to try out the desserts any way since I expected it to be great. Well I shouldn't have. Everything was just mediocre. Cannolis were not fresh it was stale. The filling was just okay. I had better cannolis from Wegmans bakery section. The so called strawberry shortcake parfait that they don't know the name of was a mess in a cup. It looked like a mess and it tasted like store bought. Sucks because again, this place is well known for many things and maybe it's just the location and the employees but I wouldn't recommend it. We will try again but the original shop in the future.",0
I was so excited to try this place but my entire experience was brought down by one employee. He was so rude and unwelcoming. He wouldn't even answer our questions when we needed clarification. I wasn't able to get his name because they don't have name tags. He wasn't able to hear me through my mask so he looked at me with a stank face and continued to speak to us with a negative attitude. So mean and unprofessional. I would have rather gone elsewhere if I had known about the poor service.,0
"Sorry Buddy! We love you! We have watched all your shows and feel like we know you and your family. But customer service at you Bakery in Las Vegas is the worst! We waited patiently to get our treats. My kids had your cupcakes and cookies! I asked for the eclairs which all are delicious! My husband order your famous cannoli and when we open our order the cannoli were missing. When we went back, the girl who ring me didn't believe me. We showed them the order minus the cookies and cupcakes my kids had already eaten. We were treated like criminals. After so much back and forth and showing our receipt and many dirty looks we got the cannolis. The most bitter cannolis we have eaten in our lives. Not going back to the Vegas location.",0
"Yelp should let me put negative stars, after finding out I was missing items I OVER PAID for, 1) my pastries where stuck together 2) I was missing my daughters cannoli and 3) my chocolate covered strawberry was moldy I can't believe it I use to love that place I brought my kids from Los Angeles to Vegas and this was suppose to be the highlight of our trip. Never again",0
"Most disappointing experience I've ever had at a bakery. The service was exceptionally terrible, we were greeted by ""you have to leave by 11 o'clock,"" in a very snarky and rude manner. We ordered the chocolate chip cookie, lavender cake, chocolate mocha cake and a poppy rose cake. As a person with a sweet tooth, first time in my life none of the dessert items were remotely flavorful or good. Was excited given the hype around the sweets. The cake was dense and the icing was not soft; the chocolate chip cookie was cold, all around bad experience Maybe it was an off day and later in the evening (10ish), however, I will not be coming back. If I could give a 0 star review I would.",0
The place was beautifully decorated but that's about where my stars end. The cake wasn't bad but ones we tried weren't very good and there weren't a lot of options. I got sweet potato with a mocha icing. I love sweet potato and it was basically a dense sweet potato loaf. The icing was a really thick cream like you could peel the whole layer of icing off at once. They both tasted okay on their own but didn't go very well together and both were too heavy for my tastes. My boyfriend got chocolate cake with chocolate icing and it was okay but just kind of meh. Nothing to write home about. I might've given it 3 stars except there was also a high pitched buzzing noise inside that was giving me a headache. No reason to go back.,0
"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon around 4PM. The inside of the shop was very cute. We ordered the butterscotch pudding and the orange olive oil cake with honey cream. The total of these two desserts was close to $14! The butterscotch pudding was served in an espresso cup so there was not much of it. We were shocked by the high price, but thought it could be worth it. We took the desserts home to eat. The butterscotch pudding was okay. Most of the olive oil cake was pretty dry, although some portions were moist. We did pick up the cake later in the day, so we may not have come at the best time. We would like to return again, but earlier in the morning.",0
"My original review of this place is below, which I wrote while I was sitting in the bakery. I had given it 4 stars and some really nice comments, but felt I should update it after the rest of my experience here. I've truly never had such an upsetting experience at any business in my life. In the review I had said the worker was ""seemingly"" condescending, implying that her attitude might not have been intentional and trying to give her the benefit of the doubt while she was rolling her eyes at me while I decided between the desserts. She had read my review while I was in the bakery (which is fine although she pointed out how ""obvious"" it was that I was writing it as if I was trying to hide it). She brought my coffee to me and said ""Here you go, Jasmine"" making a point that she had seen my review, as I hadn't told her my name and didn't use a card to pay. She went back to the counter and got on her phone. About ten minutes later, two of her friends came in, went to the counter and began quoting my review out loud while saying things like ""how dumb is this person, it's actually hilarious"" The girl working said ""like I actually want to show them this review we literally do not care what people say on Yelp like I should frame that and hang it up here."" Which is interesting because I'm pretty sure reviews are for other possible guests, not to hurt some 20 year old worker's feelings... They continued to talk about about me loud and clear enough so I could hear them from the other side of the room saying: ""We came down here as fast as we could when we saw this. I read it on the way down it actually made me laugh."" ""Is that her right there?? Ohh my..."" ""I could tell she was writing it like its so obvious when people are doing it."" After 15 minutes of this, I went up to the girl and said ""Okay, as you clearly want since you've been standing up here intentionally talking about me, I'm leaving. Just so you understand, that review was not written as a personal jab at you, it was written to help other customers and the business which is why I gave it 4 stars. I intentionally didn't use a description of you or gender because I didn't want to pinpoint a certain person."" As I said this, the three of them were mimicking my body language and chuckling to themselves...it was like watching 7th graders interact on a playground. As I walked out the door the girl yelled ""it's okay guys, some people are just miserable."" So I guess by giving a business 4 stars and an honest review, I'm a miserable person (which by this point yeah I probably was). I also thought it was interesting that she was ""figuring out"" I was the one that wrote the review...if I was trying to hide who I was, I probably wouldn't have gone around taking pictures and wrote the review while I was sitting there.. I work in a restaurant myself, I do my best to be an understanding and friendly customer, I know how it feels when a customer upsets you. I just can't believe anyone would think its okay to treat any person like this, let alone when they're representing a business. I had sent texts out to my friends and family telling them to try this place at first, but naturally I've taken that back. Enjoy reading this review you don't care about, darling! ORIGINAL REVIEW: ""Nice atmosphere, decent espresso drinks, DELICIOUS desserts! Cozy, relaxed, Victorian style atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Seems to usually be about 6 deserts at a time, with vegan options as well! I had a slice of salted caramel chocolate cake that was so big and rich I had to take some home! Limited espresso menu--no flavors or milk options, but my cappuccino was made well. My only complaint was the person working at the time wasn't the most friendly person in the world--not sure if they were the owner or just a worker, but they definitely didn't seem happy to have a new customer as they were short and seemingly condescending. Kind of a turnoff, but the place is so nice in itself I will most likely return!""",0
"the atmosphere is very cute, as many reviewers have previously stated and the cafe drinks are pretty decent. However, the cake i found to be overly buttery, quite dense and a little dry. I tried both vegan and non-vegan cake slices and will be sticking to other places to satisfy my sweet tooth.",0
"I don't even know where to begin other than to say, I am so extremely disappointed by the customer service from this establishment. I have never written a review but had to do it now. My daughter is turning 16 on Sunday. She is a vegan. I searched the Internet looking for an establishment that would make a two tiered vegan birthday cake. I found the Butterwood. They were closed the day I found them, however, their website allowed for online orders. I placed my order on a Tuesday (they processed my $144), and I emailed that same day asking if I would be able to speak to someone about my order (i wanted to make sure that I could get the cake for that Sunday because I didn't indicate that when I ordered...there wasn't a space for that, and I realized that after placing the order) In the email I said that I would call during their business hrs. I called the following day (wed) and spoke with one of the workers and asked all of my Q's. She assured me that they could have it for me on Sunday. My next questions were about the decorations on the cake; I asked if they could write happy 16th birthday on it. She said that they only decorated with fresh flowers and do not write on them. She said she would speak to her MGR and ask If they would make an exception. She took my name and number and said she would get back to me. I never received a call. So, I called back on Thursday. I spoke with a different employee who found the note that was written with my Q's. I explained to her that nobody called me back, as they said they would. She explained to me that her manager had been in New York all week.She said I could have the cake by Sunday but didn't know that they could decorate like I asked; she said she would text her MGR, and someone would get back to me. I asked her to get back to me ASAP because if I decided not to go with them I would need 48 hrs notice to order from Whole Foods. She assured me someone would get back to me. After thinking about the decorations and talking with friends and family, I figured I would just continue with the order. So, I didn't give it another thought, figuring I would just pick it up on Sunday. I was telling a friend of mine what type of cake and from where, and the backstory and she suggested I call to make sure all was in order because of the lack of , As she said, professionalism with never returning calls. So, I called sat afternoon, only to be told that they can't fulfill the order at all...no cake, even with flowers on it. Whaaaaat?!?!? I explained everything to her and she said she was sorry but the employees I spoke to should have known, and shouldn't have taken my order because they haven't been taking orders for a couple of months and this was indicated on the website. I explained to her that I spoke with two of her employees on two separate occasions that assured me I could have that cake for Sunday, and when I placed the order they took my $144, as I said early. I explained again that I would have needed 48 hours notice to get a vegan cake from Whole Foods, as I told her employee previously (she told me she was the manager that was in New York). I explained that I could not get a vegan cake to serve enough people on such short notice. And all she said was I'm sorry! I asked if there was anything she could do to help. All I got was a no! Nothing to try to help fix this; their mistake, their error, their lack of professionalism! Now I have no cake for my daughter who is having many friends and family over to celebrate her sweet 16! I know it may not be a big deal to some but it is to a girl turning 16, who is vegan, and thought she had a birthday cake!",0
"The cake was dry I'm sorry I would not recommend this bakery for a sweet craving. I'm not sure if it is because they have the cake sitting out all day or if they bake it a day prior, BUT the cake was DRY. No moisture at all. I found this place on TikTok. Came here excitingly ready to eat sweets! I ordered 6 different desserts and they all had the same texture. NO MOISTURE :( The black sesame cake was the worse. My fork couldn't even cut through it. Sorry but this was a NO for me.",0
Meh. Ice latte was good. The cake I got was kind of dry and it definitely wasn't very freshly baked because the butter cream kind of fell off it.,0
"I cannot believe this place has 4.5 stars overall- it actually blows my mind. I have been to hundreds of bakeries, including the amazing bakeries of NYC and have to say this is the worst bakery I have ever been to! First of all, my fiancÃ© and I ordered one coffee, and three very small pastries. We had an apple pie to eat at their cafe, and took home a chocolate matcha cupcake and a coconut cream pie. The apple pie had a decent flavor, but was mostly crust. The apple chunks were extremely small and there weren't nearly enough to make it a moist apple pie. My fiancÃ© did say that his coffee was good. The following day we tried our desserts that we choice to bring home and they were inedible! My chocolate matcha cupcake tasted like dirt/grass. We each tried a bite and then ended up throwing it away! My fiancÃ© said the coconut cream pie had next to no flavor, and that was partially wasted as well. I cannot believe that I wasted $22 on this place! So disappointing to say the least!",0
"I came for a get-together with a few friends and I enjoyed the quaint decor and presentation of the sweet treats. There is a surprising amount of seating for the size of the location. Street parking was readily available nearby. I did not have the best experience due to understaffing, there was only one individual working and she was having a difficult time keeping up with the orders. I was also not a fan of my hot chocolate, which as you can see in the photo was served in 3 containers. When I received it it was cold and the staff was unavailable for me to notify her. The icing on my cupcake was incredibly rich that it was difficult to eat the entire thing. The friends I was with had the same issue with the slices of cake that they ordered. I will be giving it another chance, hoping that my disappointment was just based on the understaffing.",0
"I purchased a whole chocolate cake, which I had pre-ordered online. This was my first time buying baked goods at this shop today. My daughter selected the shop for her bday cake due to positive reviews online. I spent about $70 after tax etc. It looked nice but that's it. The cake was EXTREMELY dry and seemed old. The texture was awful for the money. We bake better cakes at home. Nobody at the bday party finished their slice and we all agreed Wal-Mart cake taste better and fresher. We ended up running out for replacement dessert tonight.",0
"Just picked up a cake I ordered for my girlfriends birthday. It was supposed to be a white cake with a toasted buttercream icing, but it was the most odd cake I've ever had. Let's start with the high points; the icing was AMAZING and it was decorated beautifully. Now the low...As soon as we took our first bite we both said it tastes like shrimp. Yes, shrimp. I have no idea what in the world would make a cake taste like that, but it does...it's inedible. It smells odd too and completely crumbles apart. I had such high hopes but was completely disappointed. I might try again in the future, but not anytime soon.",0
"Well typically we are pleased with this place but today not so much. The girl that took our order was completely unfriendly and rude, and the two pieces of cake I got to go were dinky and crumbled into pieces. For about $5 each that sucks.",0
"Just want to preface this review to say that the decor, atmosphere and employees are lovely here. This review is solely based on the bakery items. Such a disappointment! The Black Sesame cake honestly was so dense, thick and impossible to take more than 1 bite of. The frosting on top tasted like plain sugar. Chocolate tart - just not something even worth finishing, it tasted stale. Came here wIth really high hopes. I don't know if this is just a type of baking style that doesn't work for me or if this bakery was just having an off day but I don't see any reason to come here again.",0
"I have been here 3 times and each time was an unfriendly experience. The girl with dark hair and glasses is the rudest person I have ever been in contact with. Miserable, would describe her best, she should not work with the general public. Lawrenceville is a great community with some pretty awesome local businesses. Please don't support this bakery, they are not appreciative of your business, and will likely treat you like an inconvenience for even stepping foot into the Butterwood. Also, the cake is overpriced and really doesn't taste that good.",0
First off the interior is adorable with its luxurious large couches and chairs and antique decor however the dessert particularly the vegan desserts are seriously lacking flavor and texture. We had the lemon cake with raspberry buttercream and blueberry scone both had very dense texture and almost no flavor.,0
"Thumbs down. Highly overrated! Went there with my date and had a piece of cake. It took very long to be served and when we got our cake I was very disappointed. The cake was *very dry* like stale bread on the bottom, like it had been sitting out for a long time on the plate or something, despite being told it was freshly cut. And the overall quality of the cake was sub-par/ not a treat to enjoy. Also, because of the other reviews raving about this spot as a cake spot, I was very disappointed in the selection of cakes, only a handful (4 or 5) to choose from. One slice will set you back about $7-8 dollars (with a tip.. $6.50 each) which is fine if it tasted good. But no. Cake should not be dry flavorless bread. Don't serve stale stuff. It leaves a bad taste in your customer's mouth (literally -- no one likes to be ripped off). Underwhelming experience. Also, a suggestion for an actual menu either on paper or posted somewhere, so customers can get an idea of the types of beverages the place offers would help. Needs improvements in quality of service, selections, and quality of the products.",0
I really want to like it... Been there twice cause I want to give it a second chance... For someone who loves desserts it just wasn't there... Certain things were dry other things were lacking flavor both times ... Great Decour and really nice service but the food quality is just not there,0
"Coffee was fine both the decaf and the regular. We had lavender with pistachio cake and chocolate cake. Both were made days ago, I think, they were not fresh and both taste similarly! Specially the chocolate cake had little cocoa powder, it was more like food color (red). For this quality they were pricy! $6 per slice. Coffee was $3.5",0
"The cake was very dry and lacked notable flavor. I typically don't review but I was really craving a good slice of cake that day and drove pretty far with high hopes. Perhaps the cake is best when eaten with coffee or tea, but certainly not for a moist cake fix.",0
"I dont understand what the attraction is. It's definitely cute, but my cappuccino was cold and the cake was dense and not very good. My husband had chocolate cream pie that was literally pie crust with a very thin layer of chocolate. Not good.",0
"Seriously still not sure why there is a line of people waiting for this ice cream... Not tasty, price is high",0
"My son called here, looking for a job, after dropping off an application to work here. He liked this place, their food, having lots of fun memories with his friends and family over the years. The owner or manager? he spoke to was very rude and unprofessional to him, saying ""if someone quits or I fire someone I'll let you know!""",0
"I would not recommend! Was there on 1/28 pm. The middle-age guy who helped us was rude. He acted like we were a pain by asking what two of their flavors were. As much as we wanted some ice cream from Handel's, we went to another ice cream shop.",0
"I'm new in town and I love ice cream. I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews. I ordered a QT of Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel as well as the pineapple Sundae to go. The Sundae looked great, but when I got to the vanilla IceCream, it lacked the ""Vanilla"" and sugar, and tasted like creamy milk. I thought maybe I got a bad badge of vanilla IceCream. But when I finally tried the Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel....both were underwhelming as well. All the IceCream I ordered lacked sugar and how they're supposed to taste. The Black Cherry tasted just like the vanilla IceCream but with cherries and reddish food coloring and the chocolate malt was also lacking ""something"". I'm glad I tried this place, but I won't be back sadly. I gave it two stars because of how long I waited in line and how much I spent. It was edible and wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.",0
They have good ice cream but I m really worried about the hygiene there. Even during pandemic they were not wearing mask all the time not to mention they touch money and than they don't put on gloves when they make your ice cream or if they do they don't change them. Also there were some employees in the past that were super rude and try to over charge me. Too bad,0
"I don't like writing a bad review, but today I had a bad experience. First the young man had attitude. After that I asked don't put nuts on my order, and of course when I got my order there was nuts on it. He wrote it down when I ordered ""no nuts"".Second of all: I ordered one scoop from one flavor and one scoop other flavor in a bowl. When I got my order I got 2 bowls with 3 scoops in it. I'm so disappointed. We like their ice cream.",0
"The ice cream is always amazing and the staff they usually have on is great except for whoever picked up the phone today. I wanted to pick up some ice cream but before driving 35 minutes to get there I thought I'd give them a call to see if I could do a pick up or at least to see if the flavor I wanted was in stock. they were out on my last trip so I don't want to make an hour long round trip for nothing. ""We're not taking pickup orders I don't have the staff"" CLICK I get your busy and all but you hung up before I could even ask another question. Why do you pick up the phone in the first place if you're gonna hang up on customers?",0
I used to love this place but lately they have gone down on quality and quantity and increased prices. I can understand post covid a lot of businesses have to increase prices. But Handel's has not only increased prices but also reduced the size of scoop by more than half and there are hardly any pistachios in the pistachio ice cream and chocolate chip cookie dough zero cookie dough and barely 1-2 almond pieces in chocolate almond. Very disappointing experience.,0
"Well what can I say about Handel's some few years later?! Not good ! As I left my review all those years ago it remains the exact same in regards to the Graham Central Station. Now, i will say over the past few months I have given them numerous occasions to come thru for me only to fail! The ""owner"" years ago told me it only has to clumps of sugar when he makes it as the ""kids"" don't make it right. So, I decide to call and ask for him to give him my opinion on the failed GCS... I get another person In charge who tells me oh it's the supply chain shortage. I am thinking hmmm brown sugar is in low supply ?!! Sugar?! Needless to say the 2 she made me were still lacking . Basically, you get one of three kind of GCS - 1. Solid plain ice cream no brown sugar/ Graham crackers I assume and no black balls. 2. Solid ice cream with several black balls and zero brown sugar / Graham. 3. Tiny bit of brown sugar / Graham and some black balls. All of the above is so lackluster! You new people do not know what you are actually missing when it is made right and that has just never going to happen! Too bad, but also I don't need to get fat so keep making it poorly and use the excuse of the shortage when you were making it crappy years before pandemic and supply chain ! Ha",0
The ice cream is amazing but the customer service is awful. They have no idea how to move a line quickly. You wind up waiting a ridiculous amount of time compared to the other Handel's and other ice cream stores around. You could milk a cow and make your own ice cream in the time you wait for your turn to be helped. This is the best ice cream in Vegas but until the Vegas franchisee figures it out the wait will always be abominably long.,0
"We have been back to Handel's a few times with disappointing customer service on multiple occasions. We waited in line for approximately 20 minutes on each trip. My boys received Handel's gift cards for their birthday. We went over to get their birthday treats and they told me their gift card machine was broken. Um ok. Way to make that money Handel's. I coughed up the cash. We returned, again, to use their gift cards. I was told their was no money on the gift cards. I coughed up the cash again. If you read my previous review, I got a different ice cream than I ordered. This time, I ordered a cup, I got a cone. Fool me twice, wait three times....we won't go back.",0
"STOP!!! This is what I observed during my visit tonight Saturday March 20, 2021 at 9:15 PM. The same staff member that takes your order and money goes to the dipping case to scoop your ice cream without washing his hands or wearing a pair of gloves. At best, this is not sanitary and worst they could be spreading COVID-19. We all know that money is filthy and we should wash our hands after handling it. The unsafe practices at the establishment should be criminal. God know just how many unsuspecting customers caught the COVID-19 virus from this place.",0
"Showed up and the one attendant they had working was sweeping while not wearing a mask or gloves. Then went straight to the register when a customer arrived (who also was not wearing a mask) and began to take his order, take his money, scoop his ice cream, and serve him without even washing his hands first, using hand sanitizer, or putting gloves or any kind of mask on. My girlfriend and I just walked away and drove off.....I'd rather pick up some Thrifty's ice cream than support a business that doesn't care enough about their customers or society as a whole to even just wash their hands, let alone at least wear a mask.",0
Great ice cream but mask policy is non existent. Outside or not there are often a lot of massless customers in line not social distancing. I mostly won't go because it's so unsafe. The owner needs to put a mandate in place and enforce it. No mask no shoes no service.,0
Ice cream is great here but the staff and service needs some training. And you need a better ordering system to eliminate errors and confusion...,0
"The ice cream was good. The two stars are for the cranky employee who served us. First, he wouldn't give me a sample of their Ice cream flavors, I wanted to try the Carmel Apple. He said it was due to the the long line (line was only 5 people deep after us with 3 windows open), but then he said, ""Just one sample"". When he returned with the one sample, I was there with 2 other people that were too scared to even ask for a sample, because the employee was so snappy. Secondly, when we ordered, one of my people said, she wanted the salted Carmel Ice Cream in a cone. The employee said the ice cream is somewhat melted and suggested a cup. We asked for a sugar cone on top of the cup so she could crunch the sugar cone into the ice cream. We did that also with the Carmel Apple and the cookie dough ice creams. Finally, to my surprise, the employee charged me for the sugar cones! .25 each, not nice to charge you on the back end of 2 buck Tuesday (where the single scoop is two bucks) deal. There goes your tip, Mr. Cranky employee!! Also, remember, Mr. Cranky, you were the one that said the ice cream was melty and suggested a cup. So, I guess two buck Tues is not really two bucks, if people are charged for the sugar cone. On the other hand, their ice cream was good, creamy and actually had good apple flavor and ribbons of carmel. If you do go, just be warned the sugar cones are .25 more if you get your ice cream in a cup.",0
None of the employees are wearing any kind of masks gloves our any thing to prevent them from infecting the ice cream will they lean over the freezer and scoop multiple times in a row.. the kid say there inches from my daughters ice cream taking to us through the window 3 different times. I made her scoop the top scoop off and throw away the spoon before she ate half of what she order... Im not going back and risking eating uncooked food with no precautions to keep from contaminating everything. Not just what that are Scooping but every container in every freezer they lean over and drool on. If you aren't going to do it right DON'T REOPEN!!!! The ice cream is always great but good me a goddamn break.. How do you not even Provide a way to safely serve n uncooked food item. You are not essential and shouldn't be able to remain open.,0
"Disappointed. No sugar free flavor available and employee just said ""no"" when I asked if nutritional information was available. Expected more. The vegan mango sorbet was just ok.",0
"WE NEVER SKIMP... that's a lie. I've been to Handel's multiple times and have enjoyed great service, knowledgeable staff, and great portion sizes. However, I was very upset with my most recent experience. The employee was untrained so he was not familiar with the menu and gave us portions that were half the size of everyone one else around us. When I had asked for my ice cream to be served in a sugar cone instead of a dish he said that it would be an extra charge, even though it says that the Tuesday special includes a sugar cone and I've never been charged extra for a sugar cone in my past visits. He also was not familiar with what the Boston Cooler was, and when we asked for a Boston Cooler with banana cream pie ice cream, he was confused what it was and instead of clarifying if that was not doable he charged us for both the float and the ice cream separately. Usually, when we receive our ice cream it fills up the entire cup and then some, and our portion was a tiny measly scoop that filled up half the cup at best. They really need to train their employees better before putting them at the front of service. Having this terrible experience due to an untrained employee has greatly tainted my view of this place. Ice cream was pretty good tho",0
Ice cream is good but service is slow-we are in line but barely moving and it is extremely hot.,0
"Drove a long way to try what I was told was the best ice cream in Vegas. When I got there the employees were not wearing masks. I wish they would advertise: ""Hey everyone, come get your Covid here!"" Not today, satan. Not today.",0
Bought extra thick cookies and cream milkshake. I couldn't drink it fast enough with a straw. Extremely runny from the time it was handed to me. Clerks were friendly as they took my money and handed me my liquid shake.,0
"Let me start by saying that the quality of their ice cream is good, however, I called to ask if they had a product that they've been out of for months and the owner/manager responds that he wouldn't put something up if he didn't have it. However, I've come here before, and it was posted as if I they had it in stock, only to find out that they didn't have it due to supply issues. Bottom line: he was rude, unprofessional and quite frankly a jerk! I will never patronize this business again!",0
Owner contacted me and has the same arrogant and absurd attitude as his employees. Much better ice cream and FAR better service at Gelatology on Rainbow.,0
"Turns out, many if the Flavors they advertise are not available. I had 3 Quarts picked out to take home and not 1 was available.. So went home empty handed..Some might say that falls under the Bait n Switch category.. Too bad..",0
"Somewhat of a shitshow location run by teenagers with half assed customer service and management. I dont get the rave reviews considering this is an overhyped Baskin Robins and only tried out as I live in the Southwest. Yes they have tons of flavors but with nothing special about the quality at all as I beyond expected compared to ice cream from the grocery store. So many better ice cream shops on Rainbow alone from Gelatology and Asia Creamery where there are so many unique delicious flavors, tropical or savory, among the quality being much more fresh and not sickly sweet. Complete pass for me here as nothing stands out aside from the complete lack of managment and a well run environment. Sticking to my staples from now on!",0
I've gotten ice cream from this location in the past and the ice cream was delicious. Unfortunately on my last trip which was a couple of days ago we were very disappointed with our purchase. The ice cream tasted like baking soda. We got multiple flavors and we had to toss it. YUK,0
"Handel's ice cream is great. We love all the flavors we have tried and frequently go back for more. I gave this business a 1-star review today because the employee serving ice cream and taking payments was NOT WEARING A MASK. This is unacceptable and we, along with other customers in line, walked away without getting ice cream. Not sure if I will be back to this business which does not seem to be taking the necessary covid precautions. I do love their ice cream, but I'll just go to the store instead where the employees and customers are wearing masks.",0
"I will keep this short and to the point. The 2 stars is for their seemingly complete disregard for customer safety. No masks, no gloves and zero physical distance between employees inside the space. And while I cannot comment on their cleaning practices when they open and close, it was clear to me when we picked up a pint they they need to improve their interaction practices with the customers. I wore a mask, it would be simple for the owner to provide them for his employees. I implore the owner to reach out to me and let me know that they are working to improve. On the plus side, the ice cream was spectacular. Now if they can only improve the safety.",0
"Arrived to find none of the staff behind the counter were wearing any type of protection - no mask , gloves , nothing . No thanks! After my post I received a negative email from management there (I assume) arguing with me. Sounded like it was written by a 3rd grader. Absolutely no interest I going back. No regard for the safety of their clients at all.",0
OMG! I Love this ice cream but after going there this evening and noticed that none of the employees were wearing masks or using gloves I will not be subject to irresponsible practices. We all need to be safe and courtesy of each other's health. You should also know that it is mandated by the Governor that masks are also required of your customers or they don't get served. Whether you believe or not in this virus you do not have any right to disregard health directives. So disappointed.,0
So Handel's changed their cup design for their hot fudge sundaes. The cups are now designed to hold them in your hand easier but there is definitely less ice cream in them. Yet they still charge the same price. Not cool.,0
"call-in orders only for regular customers! this place does't work with delivery companies [drivers]! don't expect them to take care of delivery drivers! just had the worst experience....some guy with a name ""nick"", said he is the manager of this place, almost cancel my order, because i had placed order for grubhub, the manager didn't want to give diner's order to driver, because they don't work with delivery company/drivers lol ! hopefully owner take a note of this!",0
Lack of covid compliance. Owner refused to put on a mask and told me to mind my own business until I pay his bills. Won't return.,0
"I have never been treated so poorly until I went back to this establishment, I returned because the order I had ordered the night before was not correct, one of my banana splits had no bananas, I was eating it at home when I said to myself, something is missing, I took a picture of my split without bananas, along with my receipt. That's where I was treated horribly my the manager and the managers manager, I was accused of possibly picking out the bananas, was accused of eating it all, even though I showed him a picture. I have called and filed a complaint with corporate, they were not impressed with my treatment, was reported they would send a message to the owner of this facility, I'm still waiting for a phone call!",0
"Very disappointed! I love this place so much and come on a weekly basis, and have never had an experience like we had tonight. I'm 9 months pregnant, and we were out celebrating our wedding anniversary so we wanted to go to our favorite ice cream spot as a night cap. We arrived at 9:30pm with a small wait, which was expected on a Friday night! But what I was not expecting was how unfriendly the worker was towards us. We happened upon an unpleasant and displeased employee right from when we walked up to the window on the very far right, which was by 9:50. I asked 2 questions to clarify, and all he seemed was irritated and kept closing the door on our faces like he was dismissing us. I ended up just ordering 2 quarts to go because I felt so uncomfortable, and just wanted to leave. My husband encouraged me to speak up because I was wanting to try something new, so I tried to order one additional thing by the time he even got back to us (which was at 10:01). He rolled his eyes and denied me service because ""I wasn't allowed to order it once they were closed."" ...Even with other people still in line, ordering what I had tried to add on to my order. Maybe if he wasn't so rude from the beginning, I would have actually been able to enjoy my anniversary dessert but this completely dampened the night and put a bad taste in mouth because of the customer service.",0
"flavors were much too sweet for me and nothing stood out about the texture except that there too many add ins, but maybe i have been getting the wrong flavors. usually been somewhat disappointed after my visits here, but i'm a harsh critic",0
"Just received a heart-warming message from Patrick Frank the owner of Handel's telling me to ""get a life"" in response to my 1 star review for Handel's not caring about their customers enough to make their employees wear masks. That definitely warrants another 1 star review.",0
"A friend bought my boyfriend & I, what I believe was The Blue Monster . First time trying ice cream from the company & we were really loving it. Until..I went in for another bite & a long piece of hair came out! (Hard to see, but zoom into picture) it's a white hair & I have Black hair so it's definitely not mine. I get it. I work in the food industry & it happens. Will definitely reconsider changing my review & rating whenever we do decide to take a trip there..As long as I don't find another piece of hair.",0
Employees are not wearing a mask. This should not be optional. Ice cream was great as always. Service was average at best.,0
"Ice cream here is slightly above average, but every other aspect of this experience isn't. There could be one person in front of you in line ordering a scoop and you will still wait 20 minutes. This place is always understaffed and the service is unfriendly. I would suggest putting a larger menu in front of the glass so those in line could make their decision while they wait. Not worth it.",0
"Heard this place made the best ice cream. I have to disagree! Baskin Robbin's flavors are better. No place to sit and eat, there are only 3 benches. Its not a parlor where you can sit and enjoy a sundae if you so choose to get one. With all the hype, expected to have homemade sauces and whipped cream NOT. Brought my relatives from out of state, they were very disappointed... Do not recommend and will not go back.",0
"I eat at Handel's almost everyday, I get salted caramel in a sugar cone which is delicious! I have to say if it wasn't so good or there was another one closer I would stop going to this one. Salted Caramel is a really soft ice cream, I would think for $4.00 a scoop they could give you a cup on top especially when it is 108 outside. They want to charge .25 extra. How much could a cup cost .01. Terrible owner, not nice.",0
"This place has the worst customer service!!! The little ""blond"" child is so rude. My wife was ordering an ice cream sand which and when the girl asked what type of ice cream she'd like in. She has to repeat herself and then the blonde kid said ""Do you speak English"" You wanna talk trash about your customers do it behind the closed glass jerks!!!",0
"We've seen people standing in line for several months at this place. We always wanted to go see what the fuss was all about...and after ordering the much anticipated a common Brownie Sundae and Blondie Sundae we quickly realized there was no difference between Handles and DQ. If you're willing to spend $13 on a couple of average sundaes, We recommend you run into Smiths and grab yourself some Haagen-Daza (real ice cream) and make your own. It just wasn't that good!!",0
"Called in for a pick up but was told not until 3 because there was only one person on duty. Ouch! Who hasn't been there? No problem I understand. So I go down expecting to stand in line but there was no line and there was 2 people on duty. Maybe the second person just showed up to help and was in a hurry because he wasn't wearing a mask. He asks me what I want and I told him banana pudding and he replied with snark in his voice, it's not in the menu, what else? I reply chocolate chunk aaaaaand ""I'll let you decide and I'll be back"" he says as he closes the window. The other person working finally came to the window to ask what else, they were nice, so I told them Banana cream pie and asked them to remind the guy about wearing a mask since he was now digging in the ice cream. He came to the window and asked me if there was anything I needed and I nicely asked him to mask up, to which he replied ""He didn't need to because we are social distancing and he works in the back"" I simply reminded him he is working with food and he closes the window and walked away.... which honestly I didn't have anything else to say and glad he didn't either. I hope he has corrected himself out of respect and safety for the customers of this place...",0
"If it's your first time coming here then good luck. Customer service was terrible. We told the girl it was our first time and she vaguely told us how it works. She also assumed we were done ordering when my friend still hadn't ordered. As we waited in line, some other customers also told (a different cashier) that it was their first time and she just told them to take their time. As we got our cones, the presentation was terrible. No consistency in any of their products. One cone was broken and was clearly dripping so she just gave us extra napkins rather than having used a different cone. Quality of product is meh (doesn't stand out from other ice cream shops) but customer service needs serious improvement. It's a gamble so just ask yourself if you also want to waste your time waiting outside in the heat only to deal with terrible service and mediocre quality of products.",0
"Only Getting One Star, Because It Won't Let You Review, Without... I Was Just Turned Away From Service, Although I Was In Line Before The Store's Posted Closing. They Turned Off The Lights, And Made An Announcement That The Woman In Front Of Me Was Last... It Was Very Poor Customer Service, And You May Want To Retrain Your Staff... They Were Having Fun, Visibly Goofing Off, Inside. Hence The Line Not Moving. As I'm Writing This, The Line Has Yet To Be Completed. I Would Be Ashamed If This Was My Store.",0
"This place seems busy usually but I can't understand why. It was dead tonight, Sunday at 7:30 pm. I've been here three times and it seems like the employees never know what they are doing. What's strange is they leave the dippers in the freezer which makes it impossible to scoop the ice cream. Each time I watch them struggle with trying to scoop the ice cream and get it out of the dipper. Have they never heard of a ""dip well"" that you leave the dippers in that trickles water so the scoops are always rinsed? Tonight I got a banana split which is supposed to be a split banana (hence banana split) laid along the side of the three scoops in the container but only got a few slices dropped in beside the ice cream. Then he put the whipped cream on first before the toppings. Common sense should tell you this is wrong for anyone who's ever seen a picture of a banana split but he's an untrained teen so I can't blame him. For toppings, only a very awful tasting over portioned crushed pineapple and crushed maraschino cherries. Absolutely awful. And then no chocolate syrup and no nuts. Then he hands me the open container with the pineapple and crushed cherries spilling all,down the side from where he ineptly tried to put the toppings along side of the ice cream and whipped cream. Can't put it on top, whip cream came first. The last time I was there I got a hot fudge sundae and also no nuts and a smidgen of fudge. The way it looks is always unappealing. This is what happens when you turn your store over to be run by teenagers with attitude. They really don't care about what they are serving and when you're looking for a sweet treat to lift you up its quite frustrating to be served this crap. They opened this store in a nice neighborhood with families that have probably a little more than the average families expendable income. If they provided a better customer experience, better product and presentation, they could get away with charging more. Serving poor quality product and giving poor service just because the price is low is not a mixture for success. I doubt I'll be back there.",0
Not bad ice cream... I'd go Tuesday night (there's a good discount) I got ice cream sundae with fudge... give it a 4 when it comes to ice cream.,0
"Best ice cream? ......No, there are other choices in the Las Vegas area that are just as good. But customer service is terrible and MAYBE not because of the server's fault. It's the store policy! My daughter, her friend, and I went into the store to buy ice cream cones. The server takes our order and hands the cone to my daughter and her friend. Well, the scoop of ice cream falls out of the cone and onto the floor. We made it a point to tell the server the ice cream just fell right out without tipping the cone. He replied the rehearsed line, ""it's our policy not to replace the ice cream."".....REALLY?..... And this after you didn't smush it down into the cone hard enough so it could stay put or that the little girl didn't tip the cone over? (she's 9) So I had to shell out another $3.75 to replace the cone. I think the goodwill shown by replacing the ice cream scoop for free is better than having to charge the customer more money for something that wasn't even the girl's fault. I don't fault the server (he's following orders from the owners) but taking good care of your customers is worth a lot more than an extra $3.75. You can always make an exception, especially when it's a young child. How can you tell a child who drops their ice cream ( clean drop, no licks yet) that they can't have a replacement?",0
The ice cream here is only so so. They have rented out a huge place. You cannot go inside. You must place your order at a window that a woman opens. There are NO restrooms. NO place to sit. Not customer friendly. Maybe the business should relocate to a place that people can enjoy sitting down.,0
Disappoint that I couldn't get a hurricane 15 minutes before they closed. The worker told me they don't do hurricanes 15 prior to closing. Did i miss that on the website?,0
"I thought by all of the high star ratings that this place has, that this was going to be a great ice cream place. After reviewing the extensive menu, I decided to try a brownie hurricane. There was not anyone else waiting, and it seemed to take a while to prepare. What I received was a cup of melted ice cream with some brownies in it. It was very unappealing, I've had milkshakes thicker than this. On top of that it $5 for this melted ice cream, don't think I'll ever be going back.",0
"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. Finally decided to go with my son this past Saturday. When we arrived I noticed that it's a walk-up window only. Not a problem since we were not going to eat there anyway. They have a good size menu with lots of flavors and cookie sandwiches. My son decided on the latter and I opted for two scoops on a waffle cone. I proceeded to order when the girl tells me that I cannot get two scoops of two different flavors. She stated they go by serving size. I stood there with a confused look on my face. Okay, so I cannot get two scoops with two different flavors? Isn't a scoop a serving size? I'm confused. She said no, then went on to explain their serving size. Again I was a little confused. Whether it be scoops or serving size, she made it seem as if I could not get two different ones on a cone. Her explanation was a little weird to me, thus leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Especially after looking over to the gentleman next to me, walking away with two different scoops on a regular cone. By the time I received my waffle cone with only one flavor I was annoyed and did not enjoy my it at all. I felt like I could have went to Sweet Addiction for Thrifty's Ice Cream (some of the best in my opinion) or Baskin Robbins and been satisfied. Now that it's been a few days since my visit I feel like I can give a good review without being annoyed as I was initially. Will I go back? No. Was the ice cream good? Honestly it was just alright. I was very underwhelmed.",0
Handels we love coming here. Your ice cream is top notch but your customer service has slipped and fast. With no line tonight and orders for 2 hot fudge sundae why could not the team chip in and help make the 2 orders? Instead we stand around as 2 employees look at social media sites and take pictures. Poor service makes me question coming back.,0
"hire more help! line is ridiculous every night, you are losing customers because of this. you need someone taking orders, someone scooping, someone doing toppings. you serve ice cream how hard can it be to be fast??",0
Don't get a milkshake until they figure out that the tiny straws that they provide don't work. Got my milkshake 30 minutes to go and I have yet to get anything out of it. On top of them convincing me to get a monster shake. Just the lack of thinking on their part deserves this one star. ORDER BIGGER STRAWS!,0
Never got to taste the ice cream. Waited in line behind one person for 5 minutes and left. All they wanted was an ice cream cone. Perhaps the employees should be focused on customers instead of talking among themselves. And this was at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon. I can get bad service anywhere. I won't be going back.,0
"I have to say coming from Ohio where I know where the original Handles originated, I am apalled at the fact I was asked if I had a child present with me when I ordered a child sized cone of vanilla ice cream with the rest of my order. I was taking my order for my family home, and because I didnt have a child present with me I was told they could not sell me a child size cone of vanilla ice cream. Riley was our cashier. I'm sure this is not her fault, but a result of being told she could not, since she repeated how she could not sell us the child size cone if our child was not there. I would appreciate if I am a paying customer and I am ordering from a menu you advertise with options that I can choose from, that you not embarrass me, nor make me feel inadequate while making my purchase. We asked for a specific size for a specific reason. Nothing was asked for free and was part of a full order, to go. I am strongly debating to return to this establishment which was one of our favorites here in Vegas that made us feel closer to home. I was surprised I still ate my ice cream with how disturbed I was. I work in the food industry and have never seen this type of service to a customer. Especially from a Handle's.",0
"The guy that serve me the 4 sampler scoop is not paying attention. I ordered 2 scoops of peanut butter brownie chunk, 1 scoop hazelnut and peanut butter parfait. What I received is 2 peanut butter parfait, and 2 peanut butter. Lack of attention to detail and listening skill.",0
"Came to Handel's with my sisters and waited 20 minutes for what should've been 5. This is what my milkshake looked like when it came out, then I had to wait additional time until they realized they forgot part of my order. Very disappointing.",0
"We go to Handel's a lot for their amazing ice cream. However this past visit, we felt that the service was appalling. We went for Father's Day because my husband wanted one of the amazing monster milkshakes. He ordered and I ordered a cone with 2 flavors. The server said that I would have to order a double which is 4 1/2 scoops of ice cream if I wanted two flavors. A single is 2 1/2 scoops. He insisted that he could not do 1 scoop of one flavor and 1 1/2 scoops of another. Which seems crazy to me. And I know they have done it before. Then my friends ordered and paid the whole bill. After they paid they saw that we were double charged the milkshake and my cone. When we brought it to their attention, the server was curt and handed her $6.50, the cost of the milkshake. My friend pointed out that she was still owed for the cone and tax. So the manager came over and was just as curt. He finally gave her the cash back and then slammed the window shut. I was shocked. It is too bad because every other time the women who served us were friendly and accommodating. These two gentlemen, the server and manager, need to up their game.",0
"Went here this afternoon, Sunday 9/23/18, because I was craving some homemade chocolate ice cream. I have been to this location before and really enjoyed the ice cream and I enjoyed it again today. What I didn't enjoy is the bad attitude from the boy at the service window. From the get go he had an attitude and I could tell he just doesn't like his job. His overall attitude was just blah. There was no hello nothing just basically what do you want. Asked for it to go and when he gave it to me with a spoon and no lid I asked if I could have a lid and he threw the spoon out and slammed a lid on the cup then slid it through the window and said here it is, TO GO. Sarcastic much? I gave him the money, he gave me the change then closed the window, didn't say thank you, bye, see you next time, nothing. Sorry if you were having a bad day, as we all have them sometimes, but leave it at home and don't take it out on the people that come there. Probably won't be back as there are ice cream shops all around, and ones where I can get good ice cream without the attitude of young workers.",0
"I usually dont give reviews but this has definitely been a lousy experience. Ice cream was mediocre and service is horrible. I understand they have a lot of customers everytime i pass by. But today happens to be one of those days wherein there was only two of us in line. Employee was rude and impatient, rushing me so i can finish my order. This was my FIRST time, it's not like i can memorize the names of ice cream flavors available and the flavor options were located in the middle so had to keep on going back and forth to give ____ my order. Seriously if you have issues pls dont bring it to work. Really disappointed.",0
"I used to go twice a week , after being ignored for almost 2 years and referring people from my work , I got tired of the rude attitude from the owner , but spending 20 dollars a week and the only one standing in line for 15 to 18 mins at a time a finally got tired of waiting .The ice cream is good but the owners attitude is terrible, I stopped going and told my co workers that had the same experience with the owner.....I actually gave him another chance not going for 2 years you figure he would say ( where have you been )? But no he made me wait again for 12 min and I was the only one in line ..... terrible service IM DONE with this place !",0
"I love Handel's ice cream!! My friend and I had gone to lunch and decided to stop by to get one of their delicious ice cream cones to top off a nice afternoon. When we walked up to the window we saw a woman in the back. We waited patiently for her to come up to the window. Two more customers walked up. My friend knocked on the window to get her attention, nothing. The other customer also knocked but nothing. When they walked away I called the business, but it was just an automated machine. After waiting 15 minutes we decided to leave. Very disappointed with the lack of service. Maybe there should be more than one person working behind the counter.",0
"Tried this place several times with several different flavors of ice cream. Each time, I came away thinking the ice cream was average. It is pretty soft...almost a hybrid of hard pack and soft serve, and melts pretty fast. I would not say it has the high cream content of higher end ice creams. Just does not have that special creamy goodness.",0
"We came here last week for the first time and there was quite a line, we waited patiently with our two dogs and a good 20 mins later got to the window. Well no wonder there was such a wait, the guy took our order one at a time. Made mine, came back to give it to me, and then asked what my girlfriend wanted. I've been to many other walk up ice cream spots (different cities, mind you) and they take your order as a whole. There would also be more than three people working!! Annoying. So whatever. The ice cream was really only okay. I'd rather Coldstone or Smiths brand for that matter. But we come back a few days later on Wednesday for a second try and the line was still so long. We stood in it for 7 minutes and it didn't even move! So we left and went to Coldstone. I can't imagine what the wait time/lines are going to be like when Summer actually hits. No thank you.",0
We ordered the banana split and the guy prepared it without wearing gloves which I think is unsanitary since its the same person who is collecting the money and preparing the order. This guy who helped us was very nice but the owner should provide gloves for the employees.,0
"Seriously Handels??? Who thought of the bright idea to think ppl want to eat their ice cream, I mean soup out in this weather. You couldn't find a way to have some kind of inside seating? And the service was atrocious. The guy at the window could not have been any ruder. Ice cream was ok but not worth the cost or having to sweat in it while eating. Many other places worth going to than here.",0
"Ice cream is good but not worth the wait. Everytime my husband and I go, there is a line of about ten people and one maybe two employees working. This evening sealed the deal that we will not be going back. This is the third time we stepped out of line to grab ice cream elsewhere. This makes me sad only because I worked at the one in Ohio when I was in high school. On summer nights we had every window open with limited line waits. Customer service is something this location may want to think about improving. Gotta spend the money to make the money.",0
Not very happy.. I really should have got my $8.00 back for the worst banana split ever!!! Who dosn't put hot fudge or chocolate or Pineapple or strawberry or somthing??? On a split... ice cream nuts cool whip was it... had to ask for a cherry and sprinkles because my 4 year old was so disappointed. .. ice cream was fair not worth $8.00?? They need better customer service. They need to clarify a banana split comes striped,0
"Always saw a line so thought, ""this must be good."" I went on $2 Tuesday. The line was really super long. I waited 40 minutes in the sun. When I finally reached the front of the line, a mean elderly lady cut me. The lady argued could cut everyone because no one was ready to order but her. This upset everyone waiting in the sun even more. When I ordered, the guy at the window slowly took my order, would come back, hand me an ice cream, then tediously leave and close the window to go get another ice cream. There has to be a better system! It is not that this the world's best ice cream and people are lining up, getting speedy service, and leaving. People have to stand in a line for a long, long time. So do not get deceived with the long line of people like I did. Regarding the ice cream, I thought the ice cream was too sweet. Besides the long line which requires standing within a bunch of angry, frustrated consumers, there are only three benches to sit and eat your ice cream. They should add some ice cream tables.",0
"The ice cream is good, but the service is terrible. We were in the area and decided to pick-up 2 quarts (cocount cream pie and oreo). The problem is that we had to wait 20 minutes to get our order, for a line that was 6 deep and 3 guys working behind the counter. If you decide to go, you can have my space in line we won't be back.",0
"Good product BUT owner is not very nice. Not friendly, not welcoming & makes u wait @ the window even if there's no customer. His employees are nice though. I use to go @ least 3 times a week & referred many people but after so many chances I stopped going.",0
"It was just ok for me, I come from Chicago and we have a lot of old school ice cream parlors there so im kinda biased. As for Vegas ice cream parlors it does the job...their ice cream is very creamy and they have variety of flavors. My disappointment was when I ordered a shake and asked for it extra thick only because there on the sign you can get it extra thick with a $.75 charge. Upon getting the shake I found it to be really liquidy, maybe that's what they considered thick... my definitions of extra thick is when you need to eat with a spoon. The prices are a tad high for the amount of ice cream you receive and the best day to go is $2 Tuesday. Wish they had more seating areas as well. Overall, this place is not bad but nothing more than 2 stars from me. Its good for those hot summer nights and you want to bring the fams out for a treat. I guess for family bonding time. Check it out... you might like it!!",0
"Saw the hype about this place opening and finely took my grandkids. Got there just after 11am so no line. Took sometime for service as he was in back. Got are orders in a timely manner. Now they have no indoor area to sit so that leaves just a couple of benches outside ( no tables ) as many of the other places in town have. If you have little ones I would get it to go. Their ice cream was ok but not worth the drive as I noticed on their signage. Next time I feel like ice cream or custard and need to drive with no place to sit I'll go to my favorite place ""luv it custard"" at LV Blvd and Oakey.",0
"This place is super kitschy, and honestly that was my favorite thing about it. I loved getting to check out the crazy sculptures and chandeliers and reading how to say 'I love you' in 40 different languages on the banister while waiting in the insanely long line, and had we eaten in I would have loved to have done it underneath some Eiffel Tower-themed monstrosity. Unfortunately the food was disappointing, and it was made worse by their confusing pickup system. They give you different categories of things in different bags in different places, which wasn't made clear, so we drove all the way back to our hotel only to open up the bag and find half our breakfast missing. The best things in our order were the pastries: the almond croissant, cream puff, and pecan tart. The quiche was average and the chai was the worst I've ever had; it tasted like a ton of corn syrup and artificial Christmas cookie flavor fell into some hot water.",0
"Wow! Talk about falling off! I recently purchased a bunch of macarons, some tarts, some pastries, etc and ALL of them tasted exactly the same. Like old state desserts. Their macarons definitely do not taste like the flavor they're advertising. Big disappointment! I would not call this an authentic French bakery.",0
"The pastries are delicious but not enough to make up for the awful service. While we were being helped the lady at the pastry case talked to me, a 23 year old, very condescending and was rude. My boyfriend was astonished the way that I was talked to. Will not be returning",0
"It's not bad...but it can be a lot better. I was recommended to this place for some French bakery and small snacks. I don't think I will comeback...their service is really night though, but if i want true French snacks for this price, I can go somewhere else. Setup and staff are very friendly though",0
"It's very unfortunate that I need to change my review but after my recent experience, I won't be returning. I was online about to order (like I've done so many times in the past year) when the lady behind the counter ( Sunday morning) started yelling at me telling me I had to change my mask to one the store provided or leave. She tried to humiliate me and embarrass herself in front a a dozen customers. I don't support businesses which treat the customers badly, so I left. What the lady assumed was that I was wearing a mesh mask when in fact the mask I was wearing had a cotton layer inside. The mesh was just on the outside. A little less aggression and a little more compassion and understanding towards humans at a time like this would've gone a long way. The lady was repeatedly yelling at me Telling me I needed to wear a cloth mask. She then told me to go to front door as they provided masks. Except the masks they provide are PAPER. She clearing doesn't know the difference between cloth and paper. From reading other reviews it seems that 8 employee have caught covid and the manager apparently plays back the store videos to monitor the employees- but this is no way to treat the very customers providing you a living. I will NEVER give this place my business again.",0
"Came in on my hour long lunch break. Ordered my food and waited in line for 30 minutes. I watched 6 people that ordered after me get there food. I asked for a refund and told them I had been waiting for over 20 minutes and they said ""we are busy and orders are in front of you."" I told them that if they would have at least acknowledged me that it would have been nice and the manager said, ""well that won't work because they cook in the back"" I hope that this doesn't happen often, but I will not be returning back here.",0
"I have never been more insulted. I used to love this little gem in Noda but after visiting tonight, I plan to never go back. The Young woman behind the pastry counter, with her hazard of a razor blade necklace, was ridiculously rude and publicly embarrassed me. I didn't hear her the first time, I thought she had said I couldn't be inside without a mask. So okie dokie, I grabbed a mask and re-entered. Completely understandable. Oh no, she yelled at me that I couldn't be inside the establishment because I have open wounds, well no, I do not have open wounds! I have poison ivy rash. It's not contagious. YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE, it's a health concern, you aren't allowed inside, as she chases me out, while im exiting now that I realize it had nothing to do with not having a mask the first time! According to her, management doesn't allow people with poison ivy inside, im a health hazard. Now, I ask, had i said it was psoriasis or another skin condition, would she have treated me the same? Likely. This business should be ashamed. I could understand if I had Covid or another serious, CONTAGIOUS, sickness but wow.",0
"Not only did they yell at everyone as they walked in to the store to wear a mask (when the sign on the door didn't read ""mandatory"") but also as I get up to the counter with my mask on and the lady asks if I ever have been crop dusted wearing my mask. Extremely rude and uncalled for. Very rude and inconsiderate staff. Pastries and desserts were okay at best. Nothing explains to you what these parties are and staff barely knows. Safe to say you lost a customer.",0
Awful service. Unclean environment. Rude arrogant employees. Overpriced and stale products.,0
"When I got here there were two other customers in the store plus myself, I figured it would be quick to get a cold sandwich. After waiting 20 minutes after ordering I finally got my sandwich. When I got home I found that the one single alteration I made ""no Mayo"" was not done. So this Wednesday night I get to eat an overpriced sandwich that I waited 20 minutes on that tastes like a jar of Mayo. I would not recommend.",0
"Absolutely awful experience here recently. Came in and saw a line forming in front of a register near the entrance. Stood around until we realized no one was taking orders there and you're supposed to order at the dessert counter. Why have a register there? Why no signage to adequately direct people? ANYHOW, walked over to the dessert counter to check out what they had and someone came to ask if we needed help. Since we weren't ready yet, she walked away and started building boxes. Once we WERE prepared to order, there was no one around to help. Finally, someone appears and I ordered a lavender lemon macaron and my friend went with the pecan sticky bun. The person helping us grabs my macaron with parchment paper, puts it on top of the counter without saying anything and walks away to grab my friend's sticky bun. So, I assume I'm supposed to grab it from the counter and do just that (I grabbed it with the paper, by the way). When she comes back, she lowkey shades me for taking my macaron and doesn't let me put it on top of the counter again for her to box because ""germs."" Okay, weird that you're so concerned with germs when you're not wearing a mask? Anywho, we sit down and my friend and i decide the sticky bun needs to be warmed since it wasn't super fresh. When she asks the same person that had helped us earlier, they say that they can't take the sticky bun (that we hadn't even touched) to warm because of ""germs"" but can sell us another one? Hmmmm, why wouldn't you ASK patrons if they want certain pastries warmed before boxing them if you know that the germs are SO RAMPANT you won't be able to do so after the fact? And again, hilarious that germs are such a concern when not a single soul working there was wearing a mask or hairnet. On top of the terrible service, the pastries were also not worth the price. Save yourself the agony of this wreck and hit up The Batchmaker instead. Incredible, FRESH baked goods with way better service.",0
When I first starting going to Amelie's the food was great and the service was great..... Over the past few months I would occasionally go there to get breakfast and coffee. Every single time I'd go I'd be waiting an hour for my food and almost every single time they would forget an item in my order. Today was the last straw... I ordered an egg sandwich with soup. Took them 30 minutes (not busy) to get my food and they Forgot my soup. And didn't put EGG on my egg sandwich..... I'm done throwing my money away.,0
"Disgusting. These people have never been to Paris to know how a real pastry should taste. Everything I ordered was stale. Maybe they have less turnover. Bad and very slow service, the child behind the counter was rude and wouldn't answer my questions regarding food allergies. Would not come here again and really makes me question why people go to this place. Poorly managed and went even further down hill due to COVID. I question there cleanliness. There are plenty of better bakeries in CLT- this one isn't it.",0
"MANAGER TERRI SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY' Sisters visiting from CA and love dessert. First thought was Amelies being they have a great selection on French bakery items. We waited in like for a good 6-8 minutes and as soon as I approached the counter to place my order I am screamed at by who I now found out is the MANAGER. She began shouting at me (in-front of other patrons) about refusing to serve me because of my mask. My mask is clear (from working with hearing impaired) covers my mouth and nose. She told me she wasn't going to serve me because it wasn't one that is provided at their front door. Looking at other patrons including my sisters who were not wearing a mask that Amelies provides I was a bit confused. I said I'm sorry and why is that? She then places blame on the OWNERS of Amelies saying he will run the cameras back and if he sees her serving me she will be in trouble. Makes ZERO sense again because no one else in the building was wearing a surgical mask. I am also a black woman who has a health condition and cannot believe the nature of this interaction. The unprofessional attitude, and literal screaming at me as if I had been told to put a mask ON and refused was unnecessary and embarrassing. I am Manager of a very well known business and would never allow one of my team members to act in such a way. She is a disgrace to Amelies and if in fact the owners trained her in this manner they too, should resign. She allowed me to stand in line with my infant in my arms, look at the desserts, attempt to order and then began screaming at me with no true explanation besides her fear of the owners watching the cameras. I decided not to purchase anything (will never recommend or buy from them again) and left. My sister had a few words with Terri after I left and too couldn't believe the unprofessionalism at hand. Terri explained to my sister that the info on mask specifics were posted on their website. They indeed are NOT I checked and it still does not excuse her behavior. She also told my sister that EIGHT workers at Amelies tested positive for COVID-19. Has nothing to do with me? I was wearing a mask. I called the store after I left and was hung up on by Terri twice because I asked for the owners contact. It won't stop there though, Terri. Good luck on keeping a job. And shame on Amelies owners if they allow this to continue. Complete discrimination!",0
"What a disaster! Paid $56 for a dozen macarons and a couple danishes. No big deal if the experience warranted it. Pastries were stuffed in a box, despite saying we were eating in. Waited about 20 minutes for 2 cappuccinos and when we finally sat down we realized we didn't have any plates. This resulted in us clumsily trying to balance pastries and my wife dripping sticky danish in her hair, the napkins and sugars etc are tucked away on the far side of the place where the customers (see herd animals) are queueing for almost an hour to get mediocre pastries and coffees. The 2 baristas took turns preparing a single cup of coffee at a time making the whole ordeal unbearably drawn out. DO NOT RECOMMEND!",0
"Eeww! Very hot day and no indoor dining ( even limited due to current COVID guidance). Air conditioning? Outdoor area filthy with trash, birds, and flys. Waaay over priced for the quality of food and a limited selection of patisserie for mid-day - especially for a ""French bakery"". Rule of thumb in food service industry is that the last person in line should have the same choices as the first person in line. Go ahead and pass this one by. Again... eewww.",0
"On Saturday 7th 2022, I stopped in about 1 - 2PM to get coffee with my sister and mother who are from out of town. The line was nearly out the door and we looked at each other questioning if waiting would be worth our time. I looked around at the fun dÃ©cor and told my family Amelie's is a Charlotte small business worth the experience. It took about twenty minutes to get to the counter which we understood given it was your opening weekend in my neighborhood. The person at the register was kind and helped us order our coffee. They explained if we want pastries, then we can pay at the end after we select them. People behind us had not ordered coffee so naturally they walked around us to order pastries. As we walked in their direction they apologized and said they weren't sure what to do. We said it was no matter and that they should go ahead. We both stood there for several minutes while no one helped or acknowledged us even though we had already paid, our drinks were getting cold, and we had waited in line nearly half an hour. Up until this point, everything was acceptable. Next, an employee directed guests from behind all of us to select pastries. I addressed her and inquired if we could go ahead and she dismissed us that someone would be right with us. I interposed and asked to be told what the categorical difference was between them and those already in line. I asked if they had a different point of origination in the line or if there was some other significant criteria because if not I ask that we be served in order. At this point she told me to hurry up and pick something out since,"" I'm making a big deal about it"". I approached the counter and said I'm not making a big deal out of it and she interrupted me and said something along the lines of,"" are you going to tell me what you want or keep wasting everyone's time?"" I said since I'm wasting time let me just ask to see the manager. She replied she is the manager. I asked for her name. My sister asked if someone else can serve us and I simply walked away. Put simply, at the time I begin my transaction - I'm not wasting anyone's time because I waited fairly like everyone else. Disneyland doesn't rush people through rides faster because they wait in line longer. That would be absurd and bad for business. In fact, they find ways to make the wait more entertaining by putting beautiful flowers all around the guests and have themed characters visiting with children. Amelie's is the opposite of Disneyland. There is no magic there. There are so many other places in NoDa and Greater Charlotte that will treat me with respect. Rest assured, I'll never be back and I'll definitely be sharing this experience with those I care about. I can't imagine who would condone that type of communication in a manager and I hope no one else has to be subjected to that disdain and scorn.",0
"Cinnamon Cherie def doesn't look like the picture. Plus cold. Plus had to be remade. Sad because i first came here and it was wonderful, today i brought my sister visiting from Miami and was embarrassed. Not only was everything slow, the drinks were cold, her same drink for here was given in a Togo cup. We asked for our croissants warmed and that was not to the servers liking. Just uncomfortable experience today.",0
"Awful... If I want to start a horrible restaurant I'm going to slap a French Bistro name on it so it sounds fancy. They did a great job with social distance including the staff who distanced themselves in the back not to be seen. Up front service was painfully slow. My wife ordered a croissant and a overpriced $4.50 lemonade. Simple enough. I ordered an $8 chicken sandwich on a baguette. Sounded great. Didn't come with anything. The guy at the counter asked us to step aside and wait for my sandwich which he said would take 5-10 minutes. I thought I heard him incorrectly. Just do the math in your head to build a sandwich with 4 ingredients. The restaurant was dead. 15 minutes later my fancy French sandwich came out. It was tiny and the chicken was thin grilled pieces. Some blue cheese crumples and bonjour! The experience was horrible with a fancy accent over the ""e"".",0
"Honestly, Amelie's owner- management team needs to visit: Kings Bakery - Ziggys -- for baguettes - great rolls for sandwiches, brioche buns and of course, Caramel Patisserie in Salem, Mass and./or take a trip to SFO Chantal Guillon 's and Tartine, in Seattle's La Parisienne, or Ken Bakery, Nuvrei, Baker and Spice, Jinju, Little T, in Portland, Oregon. Ahh! those who truly know how to replicate France's refined pastry shops Amelie might have created fame, been great at one point... now days it is filthy, in need or a great revamp, cleaning and dusting with indifferent staff who must ingest a strong coffee before they open the doors; they are simply indifferent to the point of arrogance. Southern hospitality it is not, FRESH superb pastries are lacking, , good sandwiches NOT at all 1st with Covid ALL areas are to be clean - disinfected - sanitized at least! 2nd Simple hygiene - dusting is necessary to remove all bacteria and germs 3rd Donate your day-old food - do not serve it to your paying guests in the am, this is uncalled for! Macaron is overrated; BAKE something memorable BESIDES a brownie! like CHOUQUETES, bake own tart base don't use boxed ones, really!",0
"Surely I thought t the long wait in line would reward me with exceptional pastries, sandwich & drink. Not! The mixed berry fruit tart was subpar. My turkey & cranberry sandwich hardly had any sauce or cheese. It didn't even look appetizing. Our hot drinks were just as gio good as Starbucks. Very disappointed for the money I spent.",0
"Incredibly rude staff. The woman seemed irritated that I asked her the macron flavors (even though nothing was posted). The cashier wasn't any friendlier. To boot, the pastries were not that great. Would not recommend.",0
"Wow... I know many businesses have been effective with Covid, however this place is always full with a long line. I used to love coming over for the pastiries and service, but now the service is the worse. No coffee press available, have to ask for the bread with my soup, only one person taking your order for over 30 people on the line and the another one as a cashier, and top it off the register was not working properly, What a shame!!!",0
I ordered a key lime tart and creme brulee and both tasted awful. The key lime was overwhelmingly tart and the creme brulee was too hard. The quality tasted like it was from an amature baker who was following a recipe online. Not sure why so many people rave about this place. Maybe that's all they have in the area.,0
"AmÃ©lie's is a racist institution. They refer to black employees as ""the help"", decorate in blackface and have failed to have any leaders that are not white despite many opportunities. Leadership has referred to their black employees as people who were not ""otherwise employable"". Think twice before you give them any of your money. AmÃ©lie's has been problematic for YEARS.",0
Worst visit in 8 years. Nothing in the cabinet and very behind. Amelie's has always had bins full and plenty of backup. Not sure what happened but what a wasteful trip.,0
"This place is absolutely overrated and as long as I have lived in Charlotte I have given it try after try. It always manages to be over priced and disappointing. There is nothing more annoying than a pastry that taste worse than it looks! This is nothing like a real French bakery and isn't worth the time. I recommend Renaissance Bakery for anyone looking to get good French baked goods in the Charlotte area, NOT AmÃ©lie's!",0
"Not the pastry, they have the best products ever. We love to go once in a while myself my wife and my two kids. It's about the lady at the cash register, I feel she just downgraded us every time we are there, I think because my wife wears a muslim scarf, she does not go the extra mile to help us like she does with every customer in the line. Today again we had the same bad attitude towards us. That's why I decided to write this review. I have more things to say but I'll stop here.",0
"The food is ""okay"" but the service is awful. We ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches to go and waited 20 mins. We were the only two people in line and it really shocks me that it took 20mins to cook two egg/cheese sandwiches. Don't waste your time if you are in a hurry.",0
Visiting my sister out of state and reading so many great reviews about this place I was SO excited to grab some goodies with my sisters and niece. However while waiting in line from afar my sister was aggressively shouted out about the mask she was wearing. She was wearing a face shield from her nose below. Had she known she was wearing a face covering that wasn't up to standard she would have immediately corrected the issue. Instead she willingly stepped outside while I continued to order. At that time I let the cashier know how rude and inappropriate her approach was and had we known from the beginning it wouldn't have been a problem. She then let me know employees had been tested positive and they had to be shut down. That's no excuse for poor customer service. Once leaving the cafe we called to get her name which is Terry and she hung up the phone several times once asking to speak with the manager. Hopefully the food tastes better than the employees attitude.,0
"I expect a coffee place to serve coffee in ceramic coffee cup instead of a use and throw paper cup. We drove 30 mins just to try out this place and there was no coffee in my mocha. Yeah, no kidding!! What I fail to understand is why will a place that is open 24/7 will serve coffee to it's customers in a to-go cup unless asked for it? I would rather recommend you to go somewhere else, especially if you live far away.",0
"I have always loved the NoDa Amelie's, so I hate to write a bad review. I drove across town for food. After waiting in line, I got to the register around 9:30. Closing was at 10. The cashier told me ""no food because we've already closed the kitchen."" My order didn't require any preparation aside from heating it up and putting it in a box. I asked to take it cold, figuring I'd heat it up at home. The cashier refused again. Shutting down the kitchen early is lazy, and I doubt the owner would be thrilled about the lost profits. If you're going to cut corners so that you can leave 10 minutes earlier, at least be willing to work with customers.",0
"The only French cafe I've ever been to in Charlotte is Renaissance Patisserie so I wanted to try a new place out of curiosity. I know Amelie's is very popular here in the Queen City so I decided to go here one night after a romantic dinner date at a very nice Italian restaurant. Upon walking in to Amelie's, I felt like a stepped back in time and was transported to France. Gorgeous decor and I really love the style of the place. It made me feel like I was inside a little dollhouse. The food did not impress me like the decorations did. I got a slice of chocolate peanut butter cake and it was SO DRY I couldn't even finish it. Absolutely disgusting. I took 3 bites and tossed the rest in the trash. I also got 2 macarons and those were alright. It didn't taste as good as macarons I've gotten from other places. I was very disappointed with the food here and I can't believe this place is so popular in Charlotte. I'm gonna stick to Renaissance Patisserie whenever I want to go to a French cafe.",0
"I have had very mixed experiences with this place but it is the only food french inspired bakery, despite the horrendous decor. 90% of the time I come, the line takes at least 15 minutes, because they only have ONE person on the register who is also packing the pastries. Not only that but if you manage to get to the front of the line and order, your food will take 20 minutes to get (I ordered a sandwich). Twice now, I've had an awful experience with two of the employees, when I was ordering and they gave me attitude. If you don't like working in customer service then find another job?? Idk what to tell you. I only gave it two stars because I like the sandwich I get, but these experience make me think twice of coming here.",0
"In my annual visit to Amelie's, they once again failed on my order. Every.single.time. Kathleen took my order. Waited in a long line, ordered soup, a half ham and gruyere tartin, and a bottle of water to go plus a $2 tip. Got the bottle of water, but the food never came. People before me and after me got their food, drinks and bakery items. 30 minutes later I asked for a refund. Got the refund for the food, but of course she didn't offer to refund the tip. I will continue to avoid this place and encourage my friends to meet me anywhere else (Trade and Lore, Smelly Cat, Burney's, Queens Coffee Bar, Central Coffee, etc).",0
I ordered a birthday cake from them and it was very bad. It is a very huge thing for me to not like cakes as I can literally like anything that is sweet. Firstly it was such a huge disappointment as none of the guests ate the cake and after some time they didn't even bother trying it also. It was very very dry that once you start cutting the cake it all just fell apart and the frosting was very thick and has no taste whatsoever. NEVER EVER BUY CAKES FROM THIS PLACE.,0
"I used to love Amelie's, but I feel that the pastries have gotten worse and more expensive. They are so pretty to look at and look delicious, but they virtually have no flavor. I ordered this strawberry cake, which is a perfect individual size. I was super excited to try it. The cream frosting had no flavor. It tasted like whipped, non-flavored air. The sponge cake tasted like spongy, non-flavored air. The strawberry juice soaked into the sponge cake tasted like cold water. The strawberry on top tasted like a strawberry. So I ate a whole cake to taste a strawberry on top. Super disappointed. I will stick to sunflour baking company",0
"GET YOUR WI-FI TOGETHER! Coffee shops and bakeries are where most people, like myself, like to go to get away from home or the office to plug in and get things done. It's frustrating spending $20+ for a coffee and pastries to only realize you can't connect to the wi-fi. As a business you should know your average daily customers and should adjust your wi-fi package and services accordingly. Horrible customer experience!",0
This place is over rated the pastries are just ok. And not fresh most of the time. If you need somewhere to hangout after hours with free internet then this is your place.,0
"Coffee A+ Sandwiches A+ Pastries F- This is supposed to be a bakery so why do you put your cakes and tarts in a refrigerated case that drys them out! Seriously, I've been to bakeries that have been around for 50 years and they make their pastries fresh each morning and by the afternoon are sold out without ever needing a refrigerator. Just put them in a glass case like every other bakery! No need for a refrigerator to dry them out. Urghhhh I want to like you guys so much!",0
"They are ok. Personally I have had much better desserts (brownies, macroons, turnovers, and others) from other bakeries that taste much better and sometimes are even cheaper. You are paying for the name, not quality of the product",0
Everything sunshine and sparkles over here until I didn't get what I ordered despite pointing out the item and no one picks up their phone. I recommend Whole Foods for fresh fruit tart. Service in daytime at AmÃ©lie's is significantly better than evening.,0
"Very disappointing. The ""Fig, Bacon and Brie Tartine"" was made with fig jam - that's not the same as figs. Our quiche was undercooked. The coffee was luke warm and bitter. We asked for hot coffee and the server quipped, ""It was made 20 minutes ago."" We tried to improve it with cream and the server was defensive and rude about it. We dumped the lousy brew and went to Starbucks - not my favorite place but their coffee was hot, they're consistent in their product offering and Starbucks cares about their customers. There are plenty of other places that appreciate our dining dollars.",0
"Very disappointed. I've been to the Amelie's uptown and had a totally different experience. This one was dirty and disorganized. Trash on the floor, and no workers around to help with anything. Our sandwiches were good but the ambiance and service ruined our experience. Who is running this place?! I could understand if they only served coffee, but serving food without decent service or someone cleaning the table and floors makes no sense. This location does have parking but I definitely will not return.",0
"I would have to use the word pretentious to describe this place. I've been here more than enough time to realized that I've spent too much unnecessary time and money waiting in line to get mediocre pastries. Yes yes, it's the only French bakery in Charlotte that's open 24/7 so I guess in a way, you kinda don't have a choice if you're craving for pastries late night. I usually just get the Napoleon bc I gave up on everything else that are offered there but for the past few times, even the Napoleon is not even worth the wait anymore. The price keeps increasing and yet, it keeps getting smaller and smaller...why? The macarons are wayyyy too sweet. They're supposed all be different flavors but to me, they all just taste like sugar. Their croissants are way too soft to be French crossiants. Where's the flaky buttery goodness that a crossiant supposed to have?!? Their fruit tarts' crust is too dense. You can get one from Harris teether that'll probably taste the same for half the cost. Amelie's hasn't been the same and not particularly in a good way. Good for a late night hangout spot if you're still in college but not so great for good quality French pastries.",0
"Terrible service, not only messed the order up, but then said we ordered it wrong. They came out and said they would do me a favor, and give me what I originally ordered. Was very disappointed, because we had heard good things. Everyone makes mistakes, but to compound it and act like it was our fault. And patronize me and say, but we won't charge you extra, for what I had originally ordered! $23.00 for a couple of breakfast sandwiches and drinks, but the attitude was free! Thanks but no thanks! The rude server was MJ!",0
"Overpriced everything. Yeah I get it. French french french but so what, that doesnt mean inflate inflate inflate pricing! Macaroons are overpriced. Caramel brownie is just a flourless brownie with caramel, nothing extraordinary. Tarts are dry. Their cakes are fairly good. And Not a fan of bathrooms not offering one for strictly women. I think ladies should have an exclusive option. My suggestion:cut down on the decorative boxes and packaging to offer better costs on menu items. This is speaking from a Creole person familiar with great quality french foods.",0
"The Yelp rating brought us here. The experience and the food will keep us away. This place is definitely overrated, and an absolute fraud of a ""french bakery/cafe."" Entering the restaurant, you feel a darkness that does not match the mood of Paris at all! The hodge-podge of furniture and items meant to be eclectic parisian trinkets, seem displaced in an undefined space that isn't warm and doesn't have ambience. I was especially disappointed that the pastries- which they should perfect as a core competency- were truly disappointing. Every croissant was crispy! We ordered 6! Worst of all, the option of spinach on the breakfast sandwich-is actually dried frozen spinach! The one good thing I had was a Layered Latte, and it was delicious! For that, I give it a star. Needless to say, I won't be back; but truly hope the owner(s) of this place will have a real Parisian experience and revamp this attempt at offering one!",0
"I feel like this place is overhyped. The first time i had it, my boyfriend bought me a box of different pastries and it was okay and expected more. Second time I ordered cake for his birthday and side desserts. It tasted stale and wasn't worth the price. Haven't been back since and i don't think I ever will.",0
"I requested for a mixed berry tart to be warmed up. In the past the servers advise that they normally don't warm it up but they gladly assist with my request. The manager refused to warm it up this time because it ""falls apart"". I advised that I was the customer and that I was willing to take the chance because the tart has never fallen apart and that it wasn't an issue if it did. The manager refused once more and showed no type of interest in keeping my business. Very disappointing experience at this location and with the current staff for a simple request. I wouldn't recommend this location. Needless to say I didn't purchase the tart.",0
"First, the interior is a huge kitsch. Second, the food wasn't good. I orderd tartines with ham, brie and figs. The bread was ok, nothing special. Instead of normal ham there was fried bacon(?). Brie was melted and tasted like ordinary melted cheese and figs weren't fresh (write in the menu that the figs are from jam). I paid $6 for that. I think, it didn't worth it. I haven't tried pastry, so I can't tell anything about. Maybe it's good and people come here because of it, so that is why not 1 star.",0
The drip coffee is pretty good. The chia latte is wonderful according to my wife. The salted caramel brownie is terrific. The attitude we received when we ordered SUCKED! :( My coffee was a 1/4 empty. I asked for it to be topped off and the snotty girl still didn't fill it up. If it were gas station coffee and were cheap it would not be a big deal. However when you drop over $15 and you're treated like your inconviencing an employee it's unacceptable.,0
"Stopped by there Sunday morning while walking my 5lb Yorkie asking for a menu so that I can step outside to place an order, for some reason couldn't pull up the menu on my phone. Unfortunately the woman behind counter, no mask, couldn't see past the Yorkie, kept telling me I can order on line instead of just handing me a menu. Bottom line unfriendly staff!!!!! Not very interested in being helpful to customers or making money. Well maybe they'll adjust their attitudes when the place gets no business and they have to look for other jobs, especially now! No more business from me.",0
"Bad experience! I went in with a few friends and ordered the three cinnamon pull apart breads, asked to have it heated up - it was not heated up to par. It was warm on the outside, but cold inside (just like my ex-gf), the glaze was like a jolly rancher feel. We asked for them to reheat it and they refused to take it back ""once it left the counter"" we would have to purchase another one..... totally not the way to run a business",0
"I don't get the people who think this is the best bakery in the world. I have tried something here a half-dozen times, and each time, the only thing I ever thought was OK was the coffee. The last 2 times I didn't even bother going in. Instead, my wife and her friend waited in line for an eternity to get small boxes of treats to eat on the way home from the breweries. Although I am always pleased to create a reminder in my google calendar when I can remind my wife of a time I was right - it will also remind of a time when my wife spent my money on overpriced pastries that are dry, and more or less bland. Both times my wife agreed that it was not very good, when her friend asked ""why is it so busy then?!?"" my wife responded ""sheeple."" Luckily Abari and Free Range brewing are close enough to where the wife was able to drop me and her friends husband off to drink and play TMNT: the arcade game!",0
"Parking: I arrived at this location around 9PM at night and the parking was FULL. Very hard to find parking and when I did find parking, customers had their cars overlapped into the adjacent spot. So yeah, it aggravated me just a little. Inside the Cafe: First impression? Wow. This is a small place. It was genuinely busy. The line stretched all the way to the backroom. My friends and I waited about 10 minutes just to get to see the actual sweets and food. Menu: It's a cute menu. Hard to read when you're all the way in the back. Food: Expensive. Almost $2 per macaron & not a very wide selection of macarons either. I bought some sort of chocolate cake while my friends decided to get the macarons. My cake was $6-ish. It was very sweet. I didn't finish it because it was just too sweet for me to finish. The macarons that my friends bought were slightly stale. They weren't too impressed with the visit either. It might have been just that night. I'll try again when I'm in the area.",0
"My boyfriend took me here & the food & drinks were pretty pricy & I wasn't honestly impressed with what I had. I probably wouldn't go back, but they do a lot of business from what I can tell so it could be that I just ordered the wrong item. The decor & vibe is pretty cool & chill so I think that may have a lot to do with why people like it so much.",0
"FROZEN baked goods? The lady in front of me asked for something that was out of stock in the display, so the counter person said they could go check in the freezer for more...come on. This is supposed to be one of the better bakeries in charlotte, and they are serving frozen baked goods. That is a big no no. I've been here a couple of times now, and this time I came on a Tuesday around 12pm. I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a turkey sandwich... I have never been extremely impressed by Amelie's. Seems like it is a bunch of bells and whistles.",0
Everything was good experience but they prices are high we also order a lemonade and it was very bitter as fuck !!,0
"Just ordered cafe caramel creme at 12:30 8/2. So disappointing! Doesn't taste anything like what I usually order. I even asked if the coffee had caramel. I think there is too much turnover here. No consistency in the way they make their coffee anymore. I have had some great coffee here, and I never have to add a thing. 7th Street coffee is my new go to place for consistently good coffee!",0
I'm not sure what happened to the Amelie's I have known and loved. It is not up to the same caliber as it used to be. The coffee was bland and served in paper cups instead of a real cup. I could see abundance of them on top of the espresso machine. Not only that. No attempt was given to make it even look good. No design. My cappuccino was mostly foam. I used to love coming here and drove here 20+ minutes hoping for a great cup of coffee but was met with disappointment. Needless to say I will not even dream of coming back here.,0
Really losing its touch! Total fail today; my husband just waited 40 mins for a bread pudding (suppose to be 12 mins) then it was burned (Black)...I'm shocked they still brought it out. The worst part is the nonchalant attitude when he took it to the front to complain. Other stuff happened on this visit but this took the cake. Disappointed...,0
If you're looking for a nice clean sanitized place this isn't the place for you. It feels like you're sitting in a dusty old cafe. The lamps have thick layer of dust and the ceilings look like their Rotting and falling off.,0
Overall extremely disappointed. We ordered a salted caramel brownie after seeing the amazing reviews and were not pleased. The brownie tasted over cooked and raw at the same time. It was very bitter and has no salt on it. We couldn't even cut through it with out plastic utensils. My daughter order the strawberry cream cheese pastry which was pretty good. Prices are a little high. The water station had warm water... not a fan. The decorations were not my cup of tea but they fit the overall theme of the cafe. One thing that stood out was a awkwardly placed painting of a strange little girl in the bathroom. Would not be returning or recommending to anyone. There are plenty of coffee places near by that are way better. I would recommend checking out the smelly cat coffee bar.,0
"Today I went to this place for the first time in over a year and remembered why I will not be going back. The people who work here feel like they are entitled to something on top of everything being super overpriced. Not sure why but they have such a bad attitude. I asked for two coffees and they gave them to me in to go cups, whatever you guys do I don't care but I politely said that I didn't need the lids because I was having the coffee there (my bad for trying to reduce the plastic consumption) the barista gave me the worst look making me feel bad for saying no to the lids. Then she left them on the counter and ended up throwing them in the trash not trying to reuse them.... So much for trying to save the planet amelie's!!",0
"The pastries were not that great. A friend had recommended to us, so we had high expectations but left disappointed. The strawberry dessert and the danish we had were dry, the chocolate torte was hard/tough like it had been sitting refrigerated for a few days. The best was the eclaire. It's a cute place, but there are better bakeries that aren't as expensive.",0
"Very over hyped bakery/cafe. The decor is hideous, although many people will call it ""abstract."" It looks as if you bought chairs and tables from 10 different garage sales and put them all in one location. The desserts were not bad, but not great either. Ordered two desserts and two iced coffees when I visited. The desserts were served promptly, but the girl with orange hair that served the iced coffee couldn't be bothered as she was on her phone.",0
"I love the pastries here, I've never had to complain about them but the customer service is horrible. I bought my dog inside and I was holding him and they told me I had to leave immediately because they do not allow pets inside. I understand that, but they could have let me order first and then go outside with my dog. But no they said I had to leave, I couldn't even order what I wanted. There should be a sign saying ""no pets allowed"" instead of them kicking me out the place. I honestly wanted to say something about it, but I'm not the type of person to create a scene in front of a lot of customers. I'm very disappointed. Never coming to that location again.",0
"If you are looking for a place with good customer service or reasonable prices, this is NOT it. I waited more than 10 mins for a yogurt cup while 4 employees stood behind the counter chatting in the nearly empty shop. When the yogurt finally came, it was 4oz for $4.50. Tasted good, but definitely not worth the cost, especially considering the wait. I keep wanting to like this place...",0
"AMELIE'S: A LOVE - HATE RELATIONSHIP. Like the French, AmÃ©lie's is a dichotomy. I love France and French people in general. I hate haughty Parisians. In fact, most French people hate Parisians. LOL. I love Louis Vuitton leather goods, so maybe I would be considered haughty too? C'est possible. I love French food and wine, period. French people shop for fresh bread and food on a (sometimes twice) daily basis. They insist on fresh or the shop keeper will receive a ""tsk, tsk, tsk."" French people demand BETTER - everything.

I find this highly unethical, extremely saddening, and completely unnecessary. {SMH} Despite my recent disappointments, Amelie's has a friendly, warm, inviting feel of a French cafÃ©, and there's always the possibility that the salted caramel brownie will be properly made that day....so I always visit AmÃ©lie's when I journey to Charlotte to eat or shop. Que plus tard mes amis. Ã bientÃ´t.",0
"At first I was taken with the Ambience. The pastries are works of art. And some of the pastries are delightful in taste. But all in all, I find this place overrated and overpriced. Sure, some pastries warrant a price that reflects the time involved in their making, but I've found myself and my family eating some only because they cost so damned much, there is no way I'm throwing them out. It is, however, a fun place to meet for business or hang with friends. Definitely more eclectic, than luxurious in decor. The primary reason I am not eager to return is the lack of love from the staff. When I am paying top dollar for something, I insist that at least pretend to value my business.",0
"My friend picked me up a macaroon - I was sadly unimpressed. It was not delicate as I had anticipated but rather bulky, chewy and on the stale side. Really disappointing",0
"Not serving on plates for dine-in customers, because ""too busy"" is not an excuse. Live what you preach ...",0
"Multiple people have raved about this place, so I was very disappointed with the experience. This is what we ordered: Napoleon: Is there ice cream in this? How about some flavor? Blech. Key lime pie tart: Eh, pretty bland. Caramel apple cake: Cooked a few weeks ago, I think. Soooo dry and bland. Bread pudding: Is this pudding or cake? Again, outrageously dry. Also, a 20-minute line? Ha! And a font for menu items that I can't read. I'll never come here again. Way overrated! They did offer free refills on coffee which was nice.",0
"Stale, semi-frozen cake... uhhhh? Really? This is what people have been raving about? The macaron are tasty. A couple of the tarts were passable, although the crusts were very tough and too chewy. Soup is good. Go for the atmosphere, but don't go hungry.",0
"The staff is so beyond rude at this location!!! I asked for ice for the water, never received it and got such an attitude when I asked for it. Then my mother ordered decaf coffee and they said they were out but it would be ready in 5-10 minutes....went up to get it, still wasn't ready so I asked if one of like 8 staff members could bring it to us....was told no, you can come back up! They have such attitudes, they are all miserable people and have no business being in the service industry! WoW is all I can say. The eyes rolling and attitudes flying! The manager did not care at all and in fact, was the one that said they would not bring Coffee to our table! Shame on you!",0
"I am normally a huge fan, but today Amelie's missed the mark. I was really looking forward to my creme brulee. It looked perfect- but at first bite I was sickened by the taste of curdled eggs. So very disappointed and no where near the bakery to return. My mother asked about the chocolate eclair- whether it had custard or another filling (she did not want custard) she was told it did not have custard but it definitely has a custard filling. Batting zero so far. The only saving grace so far are the pistachio and key lime macarons. They were delish. Overall, an expensive and very wasteful visit.",0
"Apparently people rave about this place, maybe I talked to the wrong people cause nothing I bought ($45 worth) was any good. Simply put I find Walmart offered better pastries than what I purchased. Sad, I had high hopes",0
The food is great. The line is awful. I am currently in my second half hour waiting for a turkey and bacon croissant. I have finished my coffee and all the pastries that we got from the counter and still not gotten my warmed sandwich from the back. This would be a great place if it wasn't so crowded and the service wasn't so slow.,0
"We LOVE AmÃ©lie's! On our 24 hour visit to Charlotte, we ate there twice and took $32 worth of to go treats. That said, this afternoon, they disappointed me. I asked for a large cup of tea for my long drive home (which I had gotten without a problem this AM at the other location) and they refused to put it in a large cup. I would've paid more for the bigger cup even though it probably wouldn't have cost them anything. I asked several different people for the additional water and no one could make it happen even though they had a larger cup on the counter. While the treats were wonderful the service left a bad taste in my mouth.",0
"During my first visit to Amelie's I was blown away by the size of the location. Despite extending through half of the building it can be difficult to find a seat, and I've struggled to connect to their WiFi. The pastries are disappointing, and the food is not great either. I think it's a good place to go if you want to grab a cup of coffee and be amongst others.",0
Very pretty desserts but taste it TERRIBLE. The cake was so dry and the frosting was rock hard. The filling was ok. I'm not sure why their ratings are so high. Maybe people think looks really are everything?,0
"I was recommend by a local to come to this location. I'd have to say the quality of service was terrible. I was not greeted. No one standing in line but yet I was rushed. As if I should have known to not ask questions to the cashier. I was confused as the amount of money being charged and asked that she repeat order. And I had to tell her she was adding items from another incoming party. After leaving I reviewed the pastries and bill and still had other charges. I had to return to have them correct it. I purchased 4 chocolate crossiants, eclair, apple turnover, brownie. Perhaps it was an old batch but not impressed with either items. Too dry.",0
All my friends love this place. I've been a handful of times (mornings) and tried multiple items in the case. food is either cold or stale. The decorations and the staff were very nice. 5 stars for them!,0
"Not sure why we keep going back thinking the service will change. We try to be supportive of locally owned businesses, but today was my last visit. There always seems to be a disconnect from the point of the order taken to being delivered. More often than not we have to have our order remade or we just suck it up and chalk it up to a loss. Today we simply ordered a couple double espressos, as she flings them down, half of one spills all over the coaster. She looks down at it, says nothing and casually walks away. Last time, I ordered a cappuccino, specifically asked to make sure it's in a glass cup so it stays hot. They place it in a paper cup, I call them out on it. Their response is that we're out of glass cups. So tell me! I'd get an iced coffee instead.",0
The croque monsiuer here are delicious! Even with the huge glops of mustard. But the lattes are wwwwwwaaayyy too sweet and I even overheard a customer sitting behind me that he couldn't finish his drink because it was too sweet. And the mosaic table will scratch the ish out of your phone :(,0
"From a distant land of NY I come to this establishment, all for tiramisu. As I approach the delectable sweets I ask for my prize and yet, nothing is delivered. I am told, this is a 'fwench bakewy' and the most desired dessert is not within the walls of this cluttered palace of Knick knacks and oddly positioned tables. My head hangs dejectedly. My life is at a standstill. I must return to my land of NY tomorrow without a whisper of that layered dessert my heart yearns for. All because... this is a 'fwench bakewy'.",0
"The atmosphere is so unique and definitely a really cool place to go for a meetup, study session or coffee BUT I do have to admit the pastries are so overrated. They are often stale and just not as good as I would expect.",0
"Their tarts are fantastic but the true measure of a french cafe are the Eclairs; they put there stamp on them for crying out loud. I've been to everyone location and the pate a choux was overcooked or BURNT every time. Im in the industry I get it, you forget the last tray or the oven's too hot the first batch but, you DON'T serve those. There is literally a waste sheet for that!! Worse than burnt product is the apathy served by the staff when you draw their attention to the problem. When a customer points out a flaw in service FIX it. I will not be back til they do!!",0
"They are way over priced. Sorry people, hate to bust your bubble, but I've had better and not for this price. $36.00 on a few pastries is insane!!!!!!",0
Kudos to AmÃ©lie's for furnishing their bakery with purchases from the Habitat Restore. I ordered chocolate bread pudding and it came out simultaneously burnt and cold - the outside was charred and the inside was cold. From the little that I tasted I could tell that actually reheating it properly wouldn't make it much better. Employee kindly gave me a refund. My boyfriend enjoyed his chocolate croissant but I didn't care for his chocolate cake/mousse dessert. Would come back to try lunch sandwiches and a salted caramel brownie.,0
"So I was meeting with a client who directed me to this location. From first glance, I love the sentiment behind the ""love lock"" But then I went inside to order before my meeting so I walked in with 2 people in front of me. Before I knew it I had been standing there for 10 minutes when a cashier says, ""I'll take the next person in line. When I start to approach she says, ""no ma'am those people were in front of you. She then proceeds to tell me where the line starts which is NOT clearly posted at the entrance. Should care less how long I had waited. Looking astonished I just found the nearest exit and left. So I can't speak on the food but customer service was down right rude, uninviting, and callus. Will not be returning!",0
"Oui ou Non? Ummm Non. Amelie's French Bakery is not quite ""une boulangerie franÃ§aise."" The pastries don't remind me of France or even Canada and I suspect it's because of the use of margarine as a substitute for real full fat butter. There isn't much bread to purchase which usually is a staple at a French bakery and everything taste a bit frozen. I feel like taking an international flight just to get a delicious pineapple coconut cream cheese ring or a simple freshly made baguette. The Pros: The staff are the nicest people ever. The shop stays open 24 hours which is rare in Charlotte. The food is visually appealing. The Cons: The eating area is filthy which makes me nervous about the kitchen. Seating is limited. The decor is a tacky mix of the idea of what Paris should look like mixed with the local thrift store. Overpriced for quality.",0
"I came here with some friends for breakfast because I heard good things about the place. I ordered the pecan sticky bun, because it looked delicious. It tasted, however, terrible. It was hard like a rock, not like a sticky bun ought to be. I had to ask for another one, and the lady realized all the other buns were hard too, so she had to take it back to microwave it to soften it. Didn't help too much. The chocolate croissant tasted like chocolate bread. NOT a croissant. Bread. The apple turnover was decent - it had some crispy texture to it with an ok filling. McDonald's makes better apple pies. The twice baked croissant with almonds was pretty good - probably the best thing I tried that morning. Salted caramel brownie was very dense. It had good flavor, but there's no way I could eat an entire thing, or even half of one, in one sitting. Maybe I just don't get the salted caramel craze. At least the coffee was pretty good. And you get a free refill. A little bit of redemption there. I'm just not sure why this place has such great ratings. Some may say decor, environment, convenience of it being 24 hours, etc. But if the food is no good, why should any of that other stuff matter? Just go to Waffle House. It's cheaper there.",0
"I'm just going to be really honest for those who won't be... I hate this place. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Everyone I know LOVES it because they think it's SO tastefully decorated and that the food is delectable. But I'm here to tell you all that it's simply not. The first time I visited AmÃ©lie's, I had to try very hard not to cringe when I saw all the French, ""vintage"" garbage adorning the hideous, obnoxiously colored walls. Everyone I go with always comments on how cute and ""aesthetically pleasing"" it is but I could not disagree more. Thinking that the food would make up for it, I continued in and picked out a macaron and a raspberry tart. I was very disappointed because both desserts tasted bland and lifeless. I have since been back multiple times and have yet to find a dessert that is even remotely worth the money. I have a friend who makes macrons that taste 100x better than AmÃ©lie's do. I'm tired of people begging to come here and suggesting it as a hang out 95% of the time. N.C. needs to step up its coffee/dessert shop game because this is clearly missing the mark. Don't waste your money.",0
"Salut Yelp! ca va? moi? Je suis bien! What can I say about Amelie? other than it's a really creepy French movie, however this is a 24 hour bakery!! 20 FREAKING 4 HOURS! I was so hyped to go here! My second night in Charlotte I had to go. I went around 11 at night, and it was pretty busy! There was a lot in the case I would have thought they would be empty. NOPE! The interior of the bakery was kinda over the top. with RB and hip hop music. I was expecting French tones. Oh well that's not the issue here The pricing as okay... not a fan of the pricing on the little bits. almost 2 bucks for a small that can be eaten in one chew. NO thank you! The tarts however were yummy, about 4 bucks or so which is what I would expect, in KC it would have been 5 or 6 dollars. My biggest issue, the french macaroons. The cookie was made correctly, however the filling was not. It was like they just got jelly from the store and spread it on. And the creme... was it creme?! Idk, but it was horrible! If you all every had French macaroons you know the filling is what makes the cookie. and I wasted about 12ish dollars on 5 macaroons in which I only ate1/2 of one. My gf ate 1 and we just left the rest in the hotel trash Would I come back? probably they also have a real food menu too. I've give it a try again but won't be buying the french macaroons.",0
Yet another frozen napoleon.... and an attempt from a rather rude individual to educate me.... considering I have been eating them for over 30 years... it fell on deaf ears... and he was a douche bag to boot. Then tried to educate me on health code.... I'm food and safety certified and my first restaurant I owned at 18.. again on deaf ears... he was again a douche... me brining a major celebrity in the music industry here as a treat was a mistake.... we both returned our desserts.,0
"Used to be a wonderful place. Went there recently and it has gone downhill. Grungy environment, dirty tables and floors, staff was rude (when we got to checkout we decided to add one more pastry and the employee gave attitude). All of this would be excusable if the food was great. My breakfast sandwich was dry and had no flavor. The macaron was chewy and dry. Very disappointing! I will be trying the new petit macaron shop next time.",0
"The quality has fallin to the way side. No more real butter cream, BUT Grease Cream they buy in 5 gallon buckets ! ! Frozen desserts defrosted, STALE Brownies this place has seen its hay day its over with Amelies,",0
"After moving to the area, my SO and I were given the recommendation to check out this bakery. We made the trip over on a Sunday morning. It was a bit of a drive from where we live, but it was highly recommended. We got there and due to the early morning day/time, it wasn't busy. After a brief study of the pastry case, we made our selections. Palmiers, a couple of croissants, an eclair, and a few other things. We took our items to go in our usual practice of eating at home. The quality and taste overall was a bit ""meh"". It seemed like they didn't use full butter and cream that is expected from French pastries. Perhaps, lower quality substitutes? The overall conclusion was that we've had better and it wasn't really worth the trip. The layout and decor was a bit artsy and a little overdone. It seemed cluttered to us, but take into account that we are both trained to look for points of egress in an emergency. You can probably take the review with a grain of salt because I've been cooking and baking for 26 years and taught culinary for a number of those years and we've both been all over the world and had many local cuisines in our travels. Our expectations tend to be higher than most.",0
"Amelie's is really going downhill ... We used to adore this place ... Food quality, service, understaffed - has all gone down ... Maybe ego is the issue- maybe time for them to get a competitor so they care again. Only reason for two stars is some pastries are still yummy ... My chai latte was water downed yuck!",0
"I wanted to like this place after hearing such great things. I visited today with my little nieces. The dÃ©cor is nice but service was terrible besides one smiling person. The only smiling person!. I was there for the first time with my nieces trying to give them a unique experience and it wasn't as expected. I walked in asked a simple question about which was the beverage , the pastry line .. only because someone behind the counter called out "" can I help anyone with pastries "" I thought maybe there were two lines so I asked politely which one was for pastries. I didn't cut the line or assumed where it started . I asked !! person behind the counter said ""if you want pastries you have to stand in line"" .. well duh !! I knew that and it wasn't the question. The person that helped us wasn't even friendly to my nieces 6, and 7 years of age.. no smile , no warmness nothing. Folks looked at us like we had five heads or like we didn't belong or something. I was very disappointed in the way we were treated. We were rushed and pushed along like sheep. It wasn't super packed although we couldn't sit inside. I had to sit outside wind blowing everything everywhere and all. I didn't get any service that people on yelp raved about not even my sweet innocent nieces. The pastries were ok and way over priced. I wont be going back mainly due to the very poor service we received. I wont be recommending it to friends or co workers because if your spending your hard earned money in a business the least they can do is fake a smile. I was surprised at the attitude and lack of service.",0
"Horrible service, definitely a listening comprehension problem in order taking. Twinkie employed all of her mental cupcake ability to misinterpret the coffee order, not understand that it was for in house and state they do not warm up pastries. A planned leisurely breakfast ruined.",0
"Cashiers il est mauvais. They are sarcastic short tempered. I am eating a dirt ridden sandwich. It is cold because the person that made my drink let stand there until both were cold. The pastries did look good. I would return to this place, but nah I probably will not. Au revoir!",0
"I've only been to the one on Pineville-Mattews Road. Twice. I won't be going back. This one is quite noisy - LOTS of little kids running around. So if you're thinking about sipping your quiet Saturday morning latte while you read the newspaper... think again. I waited WAY too long for my latte, and the prices are outrageously high - as with MOST Charlotte eateries. And the pastries are just okay. Not terrible - but definitely NOT worth the high prices they charge.",0
"First time here and was really disappointed. Paid $50 for stale macaroons, flavorless soup, and a sandwich that was totally unappealing.",0
"Decided to do an update since I have recently stopped in to Amelie's. Nothing much has changed . Even higher prices and quality has gone down. I ordered a Pistacio Petit Gateau (sounds wonderful, right?) It was horrible. Very little cake and a thick oily ""frosting"". the cake tasted very refrigerated like more than a day and it was on the stale side. At nearly $6 dollars you should be ashamed. What a charming place but goods are mostly not worth the money.",0
"Nice staff at the counter, large selection of drinks and yummy looking goodies, cute ambiance... The greatest downfall and why I'll never return? Got three quarters of the way done with my pastry (salted brownie) which was great until I took one of the last few remaining bites and proceeded to pull a long dark hair from my mouth... YUP I found a hair in my food. My hair is blonde and short. 'Twas not mine. I was mortified. Sorta wanted to puke. My first and last visit. Though I'm sure it hasn't happened that much before....",0
"OK, this is my first visit here and to be honest I was not really impressed. First the area around the bakery is a scary area of town. it is absolutely horrible with train tracks and worn down buildings and homes. I have been told that NODA is a hipster central but I really do not see it that way. it is not swanky at all and its pretty close to central avenue in appearance. As far as the bakery goes we had Chesse croissonts, apple turnovers and regular croissants and it was just OK. There was nothing out of the ordinary with regards to the food we ordered. we had a major problem with the lady at the counter as she was giving our order just cold and when I asked her "" Are you not going to warm it for us"" she retorted ""Oh you want this warmed up"" as if a cold Croissaont tastes so much better than a warm one.. Duh.. Also all our food was served by the server in 1 plate when the order taker knew it was for two and a second empty plate had to be requested.. The seating here is also limited and it feels very congested as one of the tables next to the ordering counter are in the way of people standing in line to order their food. Overall not a pleasant expereince from all the congestion, lack of good service from the questions etc and we were not at all impressed.. Since we live in the North side of town we would certainly not return to this worn down area of town to eat in this not so impressive bakery..",0
This is a nice place for gathering with friends at nights... They have some kind of pastry which I like the most and I go there to get that each time! The staff are nice and the atmosphere is enjoyable.... Update: it's been a few months that you have to wait in a long line to get the service. The line sometimes is more than 70 people and they only have one cashier. So you should wait for about an hour just in the line... I am not going there anymore....,0
"This used to be a fantastic, unique spot to grab a delicious treat, but in the last couple years this place has lost its appeal. Arrogant service people, groups of people that hang out for hours on end, long lines that can last up to 45 minutes, and lack of parking coupled with the scandal over employee pay have taken the lustre off what was a unique spot in Charlotte. The treats are still amazing, but I hate actually going.",0
Cool concept trendy but really desserts and pastries. Are dry no flavor I was expecting fresh flavorful pastries what I got was frozen out of a box.,0
"Long lines for over-priced, gross tasting below-average food that taste just like Panera. I asked for my sandwich to be wrapped in lettuce, (keeping it healthy) but they never heard of that before, they told me- so I was given a plate of unwashed field greens with a slice of slimy deli turkey thrown on top. Not to mention I asked for the vinaigrette dressing and they literally gave me half a tablespoon full...my husband commented that it looked as if they reused it from another customer. They were out of all the featured sides as well. Grossness Does not even begin to cover the nasty tasting food. Yuck. I left hungry! My husband had the Brie and roast beef sandwich. He said the one tiny slice of Brie was good, there was 1 slice of roast beef in the sandwich which did not even cover the length of the bread. He said he would never go back also. The desserts did not taste fresh either. Overpriced food which tastes disgusting! Terrible service, long lines! I am not a fan of Panera, but I would take Panera a thousand times over this crappy, junky place!",0
"Rude staff. Underwhelming beverages. I wanted this to be a regular spot for meetings, etc. but I was really disappointed.",0
good at 2am when you can't drink alcohol but still have the energy for shenanigans. not good when you realise price and quality do not match,0
"This is not a true French Bakery (please check out Christophe's in Charleston for comparison). The espresso was terrible, the ambiance worse. I know and love French people and could not fathom the misguided decor disaster, which I found offensive rather than a funky American take on French style. The paintings were not ""improved,"" rather, I felt they were vandalized. Aside from aesthetics, I was not a fan of the ambiance either. It must appeal to many people as this place has franchised. The chocolate croissant was edible but seemed to be frozen and baked on site rather than fresh. Disappointing overall.",0
I don't get it. The salted carmel brownie just didn't taste right and it should be something I'd love given my usual preferences. The sticky buns were tiny and just blah. Not at all good. Gave it away . . . The prices are also entirely outrageous.,0
"I used to be a regular here. The security guard was a complete a-hole and insulted me in front of the entire place because I had my feet on the table in front of the couch I was sitting on, after I had already apologized. Never going there again.",0
"Amelie's. It's an absolute Charlotte staple, honorable mention to the salted caramel brownie, but some of the most apathetic service in town, in my opinion. I'm not too amped on going to Amelie's.....really at all. If you've never been, check it out. If you're visiting from out of town, it's a must. If you're into kitschy decor, by golly, what are you waiting for? If you're into good pastries, look elsewhere. When I first moved to Charlotte, we were all about this joint. Board games, open 24/7, ample seating (inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row), and plenty of caffeine for late-night work sessions. So why 2 stars? Apathy. The service is just abysmal and the product(s) tend to suffer the consequences as result. The trendy little kids behind the counter ""go out of their way"" to serve you and, dare I say, ask ""who's next"" in line. There are plenty of things right with Amelie's. Get some staff that actually KNOW the products, give them a little more love, and then put them in front of people. Every time I've visited, which has been sparse in the past few years, I've been in line with newbies. They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff. But, instead, I've seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares. Upon our last visit, we went with some go-tos -- Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant. Both were kinda blah. Dry, had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days, and aren't what they used to be. You know....as long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same, I'm a happy camper. I still love you, Amelie's. You'll always have a place in my Charlotte-loving heart, but your service is just less than desirable.",0
"Let me start off by saying I think that my bad experience may be based on how busy they were. The parking lot was packed. After ordering, I tried to find somewhere to sit. I finally found a place in the atrium. Unfortunately it was too far away to use their wifi. After waiting about 20 minutes on my food, I decided to get it to go instead. The girl at the counter was very pleasant and helpful in getting it changed over. As soon as I got to outside I realized the cup of soup was spilling in the bag. Btw- it was portobello & onion, the mushroom seemed like an afterthought in decent french onion soup. I then noticed that the full sandwich I paid for looked very small(they only gave me 1/2 of my full sandwich-the pieces didn't match based on the diagonal cut). At this point, I didn't feel like even going back in to deal with the missing half sandwich. I'm sure someone in the kitchen enjoyed it. I liked my half of the turkey and brie. I'll probably go back, but not if they are packed.",0
At the new location in Pineville. Quite disappointed. 10:20pm Saturday night Croissant filled with cream cheese is flaccid. Like Sarah Lee. Mille Feuille partially frozen but tasty. Chocolate strawberry was sour. Not ripe. No atmosphere. No knife to cut for sharing. Plastic forks. Paper cups for tea. Won't be back. Everyone raves about this?,0
Not sure why everyone likes this place. Over priced sweets that taste like paper. My macaroon was so hard I had to throw it out. Not a fan.,0
"Liked that they're open 24/7 in this sleepy city. I went with a basic Croissant and iced coffee. Trying to keep it simple and guage them on the basics. I guess NYC spoiled me because if that's what passes for a great Croissant down here... then I feel sorry for the patrons here. It was tasteless, dry, and brittle. It was as dry as if the Sahara fuc*ed the Gobi and this Croissant was the offspring. The iced coffee required a diabetes inducing amount of sugar to take the edge off of the too bitter Also note that the young wanna be hipsters here are keen to solely occupy and spread out on the comfortable interior tables that can house many people. This forces people out of the well decorated interior into a long noisy corridor where you get to sit on metal chairs and listen to the worst music human ears should endure. Maybe they do other things well but I won't be eager to come back.",0
Ok. For 17.56 I got 2 macaroon salted brownie and eclair small coffee. My wife wanted a vanilla latte one pump of vanilla she does not love it very sweet. She asked the man for the one pump and he said no it must have three pumps and they can not change it... customer service is a basic requirement now and losing a customer for such a senseless issue is a problem. And honesty people it's way to expensive for the common person. I think it's somewhat snotie. Also coffee was not that great. Duncan donuts had better coffee and service and that is a problem.,0
"DOES ANYONE JUST WANT COFFEE?! How many times can you scream that at a line of people before someone jabs you in the eye? Really? Just help everyone in line patiently and with the best humor you can muster. (No one ever did just want coffee and she never did help anyone who wanted anything else) Besides that annoyance and the extremely long line itself, there was also the demand that we get in line when my mother and I were just trying to look at the menu board, and the young man who huffed and said ""That's nice, now what do you want"" when I explained we hadn't been to the property before and hadn't had a chance to look at the board. We were rushed through start to finish. The only saving grace was that the cakes were good. Not good enough to make up for that, though. Definitely not going back.",0
"What a disaster. This place does not live up to the hype. The pastries were dry, coffee just so-so and the service was clueless. The Uptown location tries to be 'lively and hip' but it comes off as plastic and busy. Better places to spend my time and $'s",0
"Food is quite good.... So why only two stars? The management is so pretensions. When my daughter and I circled the room two times with plates and drink in hand and couldn't find anywhere to sit I asked the management if they were going to open the room that was roped off since they were so busy. I didn't understand that it was a private rental only space. There were no signs. Her response was ""Well it is normally rented for 100$ an hour but I guess since you need someplace to sit we will open it just for YOU."" ----- Seriously?!?! And they are constantly in the news for their horrible practices in dealing with the back of the house employees. Like requiring them to work 60 hrs a week but having them clock out after 40 and then back in under another title so that they won't have to pay time and a half. I have spoken with some x employees that have confirmed that and worse. So the food is decent though crazy expensive and the ambiance is frilly and french. But don't think that you are supporting a positive local business. I can do without the salted caramel brownies to sleep better at night",0
"This is the de-facto hipster place to go in Charlotte. If paying an arm and leg for pastries that cost next to nothing to make is your idea of cool, you will fit in here. The pastries taste good, but they are nothing special and not worth the price. This is not a ""must visit"" foody destination in Charlotte, and you are certainly paying a premium for its popularity. I would be willing to bet that 90% of AmÃ©lie's fans have never baked before. Avoid.",0
"Over rated and over priced and the staff can be snooty, but no where near as snooty as the customers. $26 for 4 items, none of which was larger than bagel. Not going back anytime soon. Oh and the coffee, yeah um, NO! Weak and plain, even the flavored ones lack flavor. We were standing next to a lady from France while waiting in line, I asked her if the items were truly French, she told me ""well they look French but that's about all"". Good enough for me",0
"Was also promised a gift card for my troubles over 4 weeks ago. Guess what never showed up? Par for the course, I guess.",0
I would say this place is not as great as it is popular. The pastries are not all that good and the place is so busy it's not the cleanest. I had the salted layered latte and would say it was good but not great.,0
"I'm just not into so so pastries , treating your help badly and spending too much money and not getting a seat.",0
"Place is overrated! French macaroons was the worst I've ever had. The texture was rubbery and the filling wasn't good at all. Waited for my coffee for 15 minutes and the taste was another disappointment. On top of that, the bathroom was dirty! I wouldn't come back or recommend this place to anyone.",0
"Baked goods are good considering other bakeries available in the area. I wouldn't say it's great, but definitely worth a stop if you're nearby since they are open 24 hours daily. Sandwiches are tasty but somewhat smallish. The salted caramel brownie is a favorite and baguettes are perfect. Ambiance & Atmosphere: kitschy bordering on trying too hard, noisy, & the layout leaves the ordering line blocking the display cases so it can be difficult to have time to shop the offerings when the counter help is asking for your order right when you first see the contents du jour. I'll be back when nearby but doubt I'd make a special trip to Amelie's.",0
I brought my friend here because I was bragging how good the place was I use to like the location 3 years ago but the service have went downhill. This place use to be more professional when I lived here 3 years ago. Now since they have grown bigger they don't care about their customers anymore they give us a savory bread with pork on them (bacon. My friend went to the cashier and ask did this bread have pork and was told no.They lie and said it was not pork but it was we both are Muslim and very disappointed .after eating the entire bread sandwich,0
"AmÃ©lie's offers two of my favorite things, pastries/tarts and coffee, but this location offered me one of me least favorite things, terrible customer interaction and service. The employees at this location are some of the rudest bunch I have encountered. When I arrived, there were no labels on any pastries and after asking to be helped we said that we were waiting for them to be labeled, they did not offer to tell us what they were. When they finally began to label after 5 minutes, we asked what kind of cake they had and two of the employees got into an argument about one not knowing what kind it was. While continue looking, three employees congregated up front to talk very loudly and poorly about one of their fellow employees and her work ethic. After finally getting up to the register and asking about their two blends of coffee, the employee was very rude and unhelpful, all I had asked was what kind of roast and its strength, she laughed and said ""I don't know"", so I ordered two of the same kind and she had asked if I wanted any room for cream or sugar and I politely and simply said ""No thank you"", I then hear her make a remark of ""Of course not"" to another employee and they both laugh. After finding a place to sit I realize the weight of my coffee seems very light and disproportionate to the size I got, so I decided to pop open the lid, low and behold there is almost 2 inches of room in each of the coffees I had ordered. I had immediately became disgruntled and walked back up to the counter and caught glares from the woman who rung me up and poured my coffee and 2 others like I had done something wrong, I calmly took off both kids and proceeded to show and explain that I had asked for no room and received the exact opposite, the helping employees offers to fill them up and realized they had run out from that brewer, but she immediately brought one up after that was fresh and proceed to fill up my two cups, only to still leave room. There was no apology made at any point, I was no rude to them and did not saying anything to aggravate them either. This was a very poor experience and will not recommend this AmÃ©lie's location to anyone, spend the money on parking and go to the Uptown location where you will have a much more friendly, helpful, and honest staff of employees.",0
"I know people really love this place. I wish I could be one of them. On the one hand, I absolutely love the decor and the ambiance. On the other hand, I have never been anything but underwhelmed by their food. The coffee is great, but the bakery items are only visually appealing. I have heard from most patrons that the Salted Caramel Brownie is amazing, but I've never tried it because I'm not a big caramel fan. So, if you are, I'd recommend trying it. I definitely think you should go here just to experience the atmosphere, but don't expect to be impressed by the food. It's probably great as a dessert stop after a few dinner cocktails, though. So, that's something.",0
"I've been here 4 times, and it's just not that good. The desserts extreme trash. This bakery is over hyped.",0
"How Disappointing. A ""French Bakery"" that makes awful croissants. One would think they would make the best ones in town. My advice for the best croissant in the area, go to The Fresh Market. (And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market.) Although the product comes in frozen (I know, I know) at TFM, when they are baked just right, they are excellent. Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and I'm happy... I did try some pastries at Amelie's but nothing to write home about. I tried a baguette and it was edible. I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen. Not worth the drive from Cornelius.",0
"Gilded. pretty on the outside, bland and cardboard on the inside. I'm talking w out their pastries here.",0
"A good bakery, but, a little overrated in my opinion. More of a cult following than not, I believe.",0
"If you like terrible customers service, loud employees and overpriced bakery items that are not actually cooked from scratch, this place is for you! The was a great little gem when it opened and not it is just ghetto as heck and run more like a McDonalds. Really too bad. Must have very poor management or just absentee owners of the business.",0
"I remember when this place wasn't 24 hours a day, it wasn't what it is today by any means. For me, this place began as a perfect spot because I was always looking for something that was open late and the early hours of the morning. But due to the hype and popularity of this place, the quality has definitely gone downhill from the fond memories I originally made here. Many of their breads are now sold frozen and I even received a Neapolitan that was rock hard in the middle making it un-edible because it had been frozen. This place does still serve a purpose for me when I'm looking for something because no other places open; however, with the long lines you find later on in the evening it often feels more like a nightclub than a bakery serving great food. To put it simply, the best thing about this place is that it's open 24/7.",0
"The food is definitely decent, if gimmicky. It's gone downhill from where it used to be, certainly. And they used to be really good about being aware of what allergens were in which items, but not anymore-- I got an item with surprise coconut on my most recent visit (luckily my allergy isn't life threatening). You REALLY don't want to go on a weekend night, because the lines are insane. If it were still what it once was, it would be worth the hype, but those days are gone.",0
Visited after clubbin recently. Really nice staff but I was not impressed with anything my friend or I purchased.,0
"The coffee is very good and an alternative to my usual Starbucks morning coffee run, but the pastries and cakes were disapointing to say the least. For first thing in the morning you would expect fresh and crisp, but they were soft and stale. The atmosphere of the new downtown location was very nice though, and it would be a great place for a meeting over coffee. Hope they get the bakery side running properly soon or they will find it difficult to stick around. Willing to give their breakfast and lunch food a try. So stay tuned.",0
My two stars are for the decor and ambiance which are both quite cool. There is an assortment of pastries behind the glass and decided to try a few. Major disappointment!! Pastries seemed stale with no flavor and the prices weren't cheap. I did enjoy the artistic and unique touches around the place and think it would do much better as a gift shop instead of bakery.,0
"Amelie's was filthy and it makes it uncomfortable to imagine eating there when everything in the building looks so unclean, including the pastry case where they store the food.",0
"I know I am going to get flack about this, but... I think Amelie's is over rated. The pastry is small and over priced. I think this is an example of growth diluting quality. When I first went, I was impressed. Good quality kitschy decor, embodiment of NODA. Now it's just average. I know that it is difficult to find a good bakery in Charlotte, but they have become "" just another place."" I'm just saying.",0
"Snooty, cool kids place, frozen pastries, not paying minimum wage: Sound like Paris to you?",0
This place has such great reviews and I really don't want to put in a bad review but my experience here was beyond horrible. Bought $60 worth of bakery and everything tasted old. Maybe because we came late at night? I'm not sure the reason why but the lines were long and I didn't mind because the atmosphere and decor there was absolutely one of a kind. I wished I could've said the same with their bakery... I would update this bad review when or if I would ever go back.,0
I don't think this place is all it is cracked up to be. I have had multiple pastries from here and I personally wouldn't recommend it but others I have been with like it,0
"This place has a wide variety of quaint desserts, sandwiches, coffee, and tea. However, the novelty of the decor (french decor, lots of artistic decor) quickly wears after a few visits. The pastries are totally overpriced, the service is pretty bad, and this place often seems to be the high school and stoner hang out.",0
"The food quality is outstanding, but the service last Sunday around 2pm was some of the worst customer service I have ever had. I ordered two coffee drinks and was treated like an idiot because I didn't know that a ""standard shot"" is actually two shots of espresso. I ordered one drink with an added shot. She corrected me telling me that drink is called something different when served in a cup vs mug, and when I received the drink from the barrista, she called it something different entirely! Who knew coffee could be so complicated?! The person at the counter spoke down to me, then went to chat with her coworkers while I waited. The drinks were not started until after they finished chatting. I asked for clarification on how many shots I was getting and she just did not do a good job explaining and made me feel like a moron. I hope they correct this problem, because I really want to keep going there.",0
"My wife saw a story on TV about Amelie's and suddenly ""we had to go""! So, we took a field trip from Ballantyne to NoDa to check it out. For a French bakery, it's pretty lame when I can say Williams-Sonoma frozen chocolate croissants are night and day better than Amelie's. We got a chocolate and cream cheese croissant and while they were both tasty, they were spongy and not flaky... ie, they lacked the actual appeal of a croissant. The cream cheese puff was also very tasty, but chewy as if it was a day old or older. For a place that's open 24 hours, you'd think they have fresher pastries in the case. We really wanted to like Amelie's... but we will probably never go back unless we have other business to tend to in NoDa.",0
"Plus a few stars for adorable atmosphere, minus a few stars for the food. The caramel brownie is diabetes in bar form, more like fudge covered in caramel than a true brownie. The chocolate croissant was awful. Gritty chocolate paste center with a bready consistency croissant rather than buttery flakes. Pecan sticky bun was hard as a rock. Macaroon was tough and chewy like a hard marshmallow. Awesome coffee though!",0
"Why do I always do this to myself? Okay, I'll admit it. I had high hopes for Amelie's. After viewing their website and reading the rave reviews, I expected something...else. Maybe my hopes were too high, but I was ready to die in chocolate heaven, float on my blissful boat of yumminess and celebrate another year of being alive. Alas, it was not to be. My $50 chocolate chocolate birthday cake was anything but heavenly, and not at all blissful. In fact, I'm pretty sure that Harris Teeter makes a better chocolate cake. That being said, however, I still have hope for Amelie's, and won't dismiss it until I've tried some of their other sugary confections.",0
"""too sexy for Milan, too sexy for New York and Japan"" That old 80's song pops into my head every time I walk into this place. It's so hip it hurts. It's been riding the wave for several years, based solely on being the only ""French"" cafe in town, not counting Cafe Monte, another faux French establishment. It's also located in a ""very edgy"" part of town, meaning there are non-white people on the streets. The coffee and pastries are nothing special. You'd think they were ambrosial given some of the reviews but you can get better at Whole Foods. Even so, I'd still make the drive, except for the abysmal service, as it does make a nice change from the claustrophobic suburban paradise that is Charlotte. It can take them upwards of 30 minutes to make a sandwich. Heaven forbid that you should ask that your pastries be boxed, rather than crammed into a bag. Yes, you say, but it's a French bakery, doesn't the attitude go with it? Frankly, no. I've been to French patisseries, in France, in US and European cities. I've yet to encounter the attitude I've experienced at Amelie's. Go if you are bored out of your mind, as it is open 24/7, but don't make a special trip for the food. It really isn't that special.",0
"Idk, it's not that great quality pastries..... And the prices make me less excited. They get a gold star for the atmosphere though.",0
very disappointed about the quality of pastry vs. price. I'm a well traveled man and a foodie. the only good thing about this place is the convenience of staying open 24/7,0
"Back in theday I used to love Amelies, and would make my way there once a week! Now even with a craving, it's a chore almost to go. I hate feeling rushed and overwhelmed. No one wants to be pressured into purchasing the wrong thing. I'm not saying that I need 30 mins to to make a choice but jeeze is like an assembly line. They NEED to figure out a more effective layout of the dessert area/line etc. I'm sure it's possible! It's hard especially when you invited someone thats never been before and they can't order because you either can't see anything or asking questions seems to be annoying to them now!",0
I really wanna really like this place but everytime I go there is always loaded of people there. The price for macaroons are making it hard for me to like them. I know it doesn't cost much to make it and the stuff can be NICER BUT THEY AREN'T so it's hard to like this place. They see us as $$$ or annoying customer that ask for loaded stuff. They only reason this place is the hot spot right now is because theirs no other's 24/7 bakery near by or in Charlotte period. $2:30 for one.macroons is just too high.,0
"Having heard so much about it, and being a complete sugar-head, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good. But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets. I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused.",0
"Not what I would expect from a French bakery... Have been there several times and it's always slammed, line around the corner and takes forever and can't find a table or a chair. Very hectic and chaotic atmosphere, definitely not welcoming or relaxing ...",0
"We went to restaurant for lunch on Sat, around 1:30 pm, every table was dirty and not wiped, our waitress actually seemed annoyed that we asked for our table to be cleaned before she puts the food on it, she said they have been busy and she doesn't have time! Hmm, isn't restaurants supposed to pay attention to cleanliness? Also, I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and it came with eggs on it, what's that about? Bad service, over price and. It that good of food!",0
Learn how to handle queues of more than 5 people. I've never seen a more inefficient selection/checkout process.,0
"Two stars for the pastry, five for people watching. Had an eclair, it was very average compared to the bakeries that I eat at in Paris. The decoration is very Dorothy Draper, which I loved. Good French sodas though.",0
I stopped by Amelie's with my wife today around 5.p.m. and ordered a chicken salad on croissant. The croissants felt like it has been out all day. It was hard both inside and outside. This was the worst experience i have had with Amelie's. I will give them another chance.I paid too much for the food to get a sun-standard sandwich.,0
"Been here several times. Just don't think it lives up to the hype. Yes, it is a funky eclectic place but the food is not exceptional and the same things can be found in other places at a much better level of quality. Enjoy standing in line for an hour for croissant!",0
Was not impressed with the the quality of the food or drink. Lots of the pastries looked old and many tasted old. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.,0
"I think I may be the only person in Charlotte that does not like this place. The ambiance is great, but the baked goods are pretty terrible. It tastes like the pre-packaged stuff you can buy at Starbucks.",0
"Went into Amelie's yesterday for a shot of espresso. People behind the counter were friendly, but the shot of espresso was over-extracted *pulled too long*. I used the wifi for a couple minutes and didn't finish the espresso as it was bitter and unpleasant. I went in today to give the espresso another chance as they weren't too far off from pulling a good shot and they had been friendly. The same barista from the day before was working. I politely asked the barista to pull the shot a little shorter as the one from yesterday was over-extracted and a pretty bitter. Instead of hearing an oh okay, sure, or an okay, sorry about that. I got a very condescending talk about how he probably used too much coffee, and that it wasn't over-extracted as it would have been sour. If it was only his incorrect explanation of why yesterday's shot tasted bad, I'd be going back to Amelie's again. I love talking coffee/espresso extraction and would had started up a conversation about the subject. He did pull this shot shorter than yesterdays and it was a good extraction. The flavor of the shot wasn't my preference, as it seemed to be a roast on the darker side of medium, but the bitterness or astringency wasn't there this time. Since he took an arrogant and condescending tone with me, I won't be going back there again and am giving this establishment a 1 Star rating. If that had not happened, I would had given a 3 and revisited the location, as correctly extracted espresso is in very short demand in Charlotte. If the barista happens to read this, here are some links so you can understand extraction correctly. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-barista.com%2Fespresso-guide-good-extractions.html&s=f5f7a84678d287194b7ec2ec9e62bb9567f008a9f1b6fa5b07e64cc66d5094da"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">home-barista.com/espress¦</a> <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCoffee_extraction&s=2c6158cd8b16e174011bc0288615dea63d504f54ee8fa97fc55912d446fe0b97"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co¦</a> Might also want to spend some time reading up on how to take criticism, especially when it is constructive criticism.",0
"Second chance and disappointed a second time. My cream puff tasted like it was frozen then thawed. I guess the rumors were correct in saying that Amelie's freezes a lot of their baked goods. If I wanted frozen I would have went to Costco! Heading to Dillworth to Sweet Lorraine's, where everything is fresh. Amelies, is not worth the wait in line. I won't be returning.",0
"Mediocre food with extremely horrible service. The staff was not only rude to the customers, but were fighting with each other. The guy who took our order had a chip on his shoulder and treated us as if we were annoying him. He didn't listen to my order and when I told him he messed up, he told me that he already placed my food in the oven...kinda a ""oh-well"" to it. The baked goods were not good enough for me to come back and deal with all of the negativity that was in that place tonight. I'm sorry Amelie's but you have lost yet another paying customer.",0
"Wanted to try this place out from the great reviews I had heard from friends. Long lines, no where to sit, overpriced pastries, and service wasn't that great..",0
"My wife and I went to Amelie's last night for desert and had a horrible experience. My wife ordered a chi latte and the chocolate mousse cup and I the apple turnover. The chocolate mousse cup had a chocolate strawberry on top but when you bite into it, it was so soggy and gross. Also, she found fruit flies in it. The chi latte was also gross and not drinkable. My apple turnover was more so filled with apple sauce then actual chopped apples. Overall, a very bad experience and we wont be going there again. Not to mention we spend $20 when we could have gone someplace else for much cheaper.",0
I find this place to be over rated and service is always poor. Slow internet.,0
"This place is just nasty. The employees here can be so rude. They use disgusting ingredients on top of it too like high fructose corn syrup- ish! I ordered a sandwich and it was put in wrong. It took me almost a half hour to get it sorted out only to be met by a sarcastic cashier tell me, ""we are REALLY busy"" when he was the one who screwed my order up in the first place. They took my sandwich back in the kitchen, put an egg on it and brought it back to me. I had ordered a bacon, egg, cheese croissant and was given a BLT, they put an egg on the BLT, lettuce and all and slopped it back in a to go bag. No thanks. Will NEVER eat here again. My first experience here was ordering a birthday cake that literally had two inches of butter cream in between two tiny slivers of cakes. Literally everyone at the party threw it out. I emailed to complain and wasn't even offered a refund! Thought I'd given them another shot- nope. Still nasty.",0
"These were the worse macarons I've had in a long time! Smh. Extremely HARD, and for $2 a pop",0
"I used to love coming here as a college student, eating pastries and doing school work either by myself or bringing other classmates. However, recently I've noticed the inconsistency of food quality. For the past couple months, every item I've purchased has tasted like it's been in the fridge all day.... So when I ate it it was either dry, hard, or both. I think this is my last time coming to this location. I'm hoping the one they're building uptown will taste as good as the Noda location used to, if not... the company has lost a customer entirely.",0
"My boyfriend and I were so excited about this place because we've heard great things about it. We checked it out one Saturday afternoon and I was not impressed. The overall appearance seems cool but it's quite dirty and dusty. I get the gimmick of it coming off vintage, but the furniture was worn down and uncomfortable. My macaroons weren't fresh; my boyfriends sandwich was blah....and we felt rushed while placing our order. Don't think I'll be back there anytime soon if ever.",0
"Normally I would give this place high marks... The macaroons are good albeit a little pricey... This time, we got the strawberry cake with buttercream icing (single serving for over 5 bucks). It was a let down because there were no strawberries (or strawberry filling) inside the cake. There is one half a strawberry on top but that is all. We will be back but do strongly believe there needs to be a recipe change for this cake.",0
Came into Amelie's around 8 am with a slow crowd ordered 3 quiche to go. I waited about 10-15 min for them to be heated and upon delivery 1 was served with a dark brown burnt top. I returned the burnt quiche and proceeded to wait an additional 10 min. As a restaurant industry vet it's highly disappointing to see that type of neglect when there are 3 customers in the cafe. Will only be returning if I have 40 min to spare.,0
No skim milk. Overpriced.,0
"We ordered a cake for my granddaughters birthday. We paid $80 for a dry cake that no one would eat. We ended up throwing it away. The pastries are fabulous, but the cake was overpriced and very inedible.",0
"This was my first time eating here. The food was delicious, but it was a very small serving size for a 1/2 sandwich. I got the 1/2 turkey and Brie sandwich and cup of asparagus, leek and spinach soup. The 1/2 sandwich was smaller than my phone at about 3 inches long. The price was $6.59 for such a small serving. While delicious, it was not worth it. I won't be back.",0
"Im more a fan of the atmosphere than the food. 2 things I like Raspberry Tart and the breakfast criossants. The environment is wonderful though, defiantly a go if you live in Charlotte and have an urge for sweet at 11 at night or even 3 in the morning!",0
Only giving this place 2 because there's a good atmosphere to it. It's a great place to get some studying done or a get together with a friend. The desserts do not live up to the hype and overpriced. The only thing I actually like is the blossom honey iced tea.,0
Cool vibe but the food isn't worth the hype. At all.,0
"The owner used to live behind us. We shared a fence. She threw things at our dogs. Never once spoke. One day her afghan hounds got loose and we caught them for her, they did not want to go back. She leaves them outside with no water. Gives them no attention. She never said thank you for catching them. I am a NoDa local as my mother, and grandparents were too. She will never get our business. Too pricey, too snobby and the same recipes are everywhere.",0
Walked in and asked for a doppio. Response was 'Dope-what' and walked out.,0
"I always wanted to go to the Amelie's since I study French and I'm obsessed with French culture and cuisine.Last year I went to study abroad in France and let me tell you that ""Amelie's"" is a bakery, but definitely not FRENCH bakery. Have you ever had french macarons? or napoleon cake? Their products may look like the original French but they are not. I went there today specifically to treat my bf and myself with nice French deserts. At first, I couldn't even bite the macaron, that's how hard it was! it was not fresh, had weird coloring. for example, pistachio macaron usually has mint color or light green. Here is was toxic bright green, and didn't have the same taste. The food did not smell nice, it had some kind of artificial smell. Moreover, the cake itself was not macaron at all, it only looked like one. The chocolate ""macaron"" was simply a sticky kind of brownie instead of two pieces of meringue with soft ganache inside. The napoleon was made from frozen parts of cream and only thin slice of pastry, and basically looked and tasted like cheap frozen pies that you can buy from Bi-lo or Harris teeter(even groceries have better frozen cakes). Napoleon is not even supposed to be frozen! It tasted like an ice-cream, and felt like an ice-cream. I don't mind ice-cream at all, but they false advertised it as a regular napoleon cake. I've tried several deserts and returned them, and fortunately cashier issued me a refund. However, I will not come back. If you want to try traditional macarons go to the Earth Fare or Cafe Monte. P.S. the interior is nice, "" a la francais"", but you can put little copies of Eiffel Tower everywhere and it still not going to make it a French cafe/patisserie/restaurant if the food served there is not French and not fresh. The personnel had no idea about what they were selling, the guy whom I questioned had to go to the backdoor 4(!) times to answer do they use traditional recipes or not and if the pastry they sell was made according to the French recipes.",0
"I tried 6 different pastry items and a coffee drink, and the only good thing was the coffee. For the $30 I spent, it was horrible, the portions were small and it was a complete waste of time. DO NOT go there, just go to Nonas. Much better!",0
"Ok....Ok....I know this review will not be favored amongst other yelpers. I'm not a huge fan of Amelie's. One night, my boyfriend and I decided to hop in here on a dreary Saturday night after being in the Plaza Midwood area. I was in search of a latte and he had a sweet tooth. While the line was about 8 people deep, it moved rather quick. I've since learned that this number of patrons was an anomaly as the line is usually wrapped around the room. Anyways, we tried the Salted Caramel Brownie that EVERYONE loves, a few Tortes and a strawberry croissant. First off, they did not want to make a latte....not at all. I don't blame them, it was not that good. I don't think I was able to finish all of it. We were not impressed with the brownie either, it was just a thick chunk of caramel plopped on top of a dry brownie. Maybe we got a bad batch or something but it was not the ""raved"" about dessert that I was hoping for. I had the same problem with their layered tortes....dry and not flavorful. The croissant was....not the warm, buttery pastry that you would envision. I would love to love Amelie's but I just don't. I DO like the fact that it's open 24hrs. and I find it a good place to sit and people watch. I plan on returning for a third time to try it once more, have a plain coffee and sit to work on some writing.",0
I'm from CA on a business trip therefore I wanted something to do in NC and Yelp was a lot of help in finding Amelie's! However I can not say the same for the staff at Amelie's! I order my tart and coffee and was told they would take it to my table. Well I never got my coffee bc no one told me that I had to pick it up at the coffee bar and no one was nice enough to take it to my table! On other bad note! I wanted to buy some of there tarts and take them back to CA to give to my friends and staff! However this same staff told me that they do not have any boxes to put them that would help with the air flight. She did not ever try to help me! To bad for her bc I wanted to buy enough for 50 members of my staff! Wow someone does not like making money! That's ok bc I could always take my business where it is welcome!,0
The cream on the slice cakes are super hard. Not what I imagine from eating desserts. They're suppose to fluffy and light. But I guess Amelie is not for me.,0
There is no denying that Amelies is the current it spot in Charlotte. At night you will wait in line no less than 30 min for a treat. I've been here several times and do love the macaroons. But will never understand the line. The reason for my low review is simple. Great food does not make up for rude staff. Most recently I took my fiance here for a birthday goody. When we did finally get up to order one order taker skipped us and went to the older couple behind us. When we did get help I made mention that it was her birthday. I asked if she got anything for that as I over heard the order taker offer it to another patron for their birthday. We again got ignored. I just don't find this acceptable. Treat people with respect I don't care how long the line is.,0
"I would have given zero star. I chose this place to write my thesis. But, in most of the days they had no internet. Which was awful!",0
Terrible experience. Booked for a wedding reception. Notified late that they could not do it! Paid in advance. Would NOT recommend.,0
"My daughter raved about this place so we tried it. It's just Ok for me as I have had much better pastries elsewhere. I don't live near this place so most likely I will not go back. We went on Sunday 8pm, the place was packed and desserts were continuously brought out from the kitchen. It was too late in the evening to have espresso so couldn't comment on it.",0
"Ahh, such a disappointment. Long lines, mediocre food, overpriced food & coffee, super limited coffee milk options...I wanted to like this place, but definitely never coming back. My husband got his coffee right away in a mug, mine came 10 mins later in a to go cup, and it was wrong. As a former manager of a coffee shop, I understand the challenges associated with the job...but this is not that hard. Step it up, Charlotte, you can do better than this.",0
"Their pastries and various desserts aren't too bad, but there are some other places that are much better. Their coffees, however, have always been fantastic. Tip of the hat to the various baristas!",0
"Let me begin by saying that a year ago I would've given Amelie's 5 stars. I think the problem is that Amelie's is pretty much the only one of its kind in Charlotte and it's now too crowded and understaffed (or staffed with people who don't care?). Every time I go there is a huge line, dirty plates on every table and a mass of people. My favorite bakery items are the twice baked chocolate croissants. The last few times I've been they were either out of them (that happened twice) or they said they had them and then gave me the twice baked almond croissant by mistake (realized that when I got home) or they had them so I was so excited that I got two! - they were both stale. Really disappointing. Also one night we got a Napoleon to share there, we tried to take a bite of it and it was frozen. I should've said something to one of the people behind the counter but I was just fed up at this point and felt like they wouldn't do anything about it anyways. I just asked for a box to take it home to defrost. I used to be really excited about going to Amelie's, now I just try to avoid it. I do have hope that it will go back to what it used to be.",0
I ordered a cake for my dad's birthday from this establishment. I was so excited about it because since moving to Charlotte everyone has ranted and raved about this place. It was far from satisfying. I ordered their strawberry vanilla type cake. It had some fancy name and the ingredients also sounded super fancy so I ordered it. I ordered it to serve 6 people. They suggested getting one that severed up to 10 people so I did. It costed about $35 and I ordered it to be picked up on a Friday. On Wednesday I called to see if I could get it a day early and they said that most likely wasn't possible but they would try and call me if they could. I never got a call that's fine I ordered it for Friday so that was my doing. Well when I picked it up it looked amazing. Beautiful and delicious. Well not the case. Once we sang happy birthday and my dad blew out the candles we cut into it. The icing fell off as if it had been frozen for a few days on there. The cake was dry so dry as in my mom has to mix in vanilla ice cream that we had to make it less dry. I was so disappointed. I was thinking of calling and complaining but I didn't because I don't like to complain. But I felt the need to write a review. Maybe they made the cake early and left it in the freezer or maybe their cakes are dry and flavorless. I don't know but I won't be going back.,0
"Am I alone in the world here? Amelie's is a beautiful, whimsical place, great for doing work or people watching. But the pastries are a flat C. I've been here four times since I've moved to Charlotte, and not once have I had anything that could even be described as ""good."" Not the eclairs, saltwater caramel brownies, macaroons, chocolate mousse, almond cakes--nothing. I'm sure there are way tastier (and less expensive) offerings around the QC. Don't get me wrong--it's really pretty in there. Like a girl's daydream after watching Amelie; and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 1/2. The treats (and I loooove treats) just aren't that great.",0
"Yesterday, I paid a visit to my favorite bakery in Charlotte to only find out that they are price gauging their long term customers. It was very noticeable that they were no lines at all on Saturday. We noticed immediately that the tartlets were marked up over two dollars more than the normal pricing! A simple small cake which is now $5.29. A tartlet we would normally have for $3.29 is now $5.29. I think what surprised us the most was the quart of soup that was always $9.99 is now$14.00. The plates are even smaller to. Even soup and sandwich was marked up $3.00 higher and a much smaller portion of soup. They don't even give you bread with the soup anymore. They even took the water cooler from the back away. Yes, it was very obvious change in management or pure greed ! We asked why the prices soared so high, and her answer was production cost. The soup is the grandma's recipe and it is a simple recipe for the leak soup. Shame on you for taking advantage of your customers. This is deplorable and disgusting. Your employee looked it at us straight twice and said production costs. We would normally bring home box of goodies to share with my daughter. This was a very special place for both of us to spend our Saturday afternoon. We notice how your customers we're not walking out with boxes of goodies. We noticed your lines were very short, actually obsolete. If you sad to see an ioconic establishment cheap their customers for the almighty dollar. You definitely lost us as a lifetime customer . Do not go there unless you want to be ripped off!",0
"No vegan options? NONE?! One star for you! Lines are always too long, counter people always act too cool for school. Even their dark melange coffee and lavender lemonade which is heaven can't make up for all the other cons. Booooo!!!!",0
i did not like this place at all the food was okay but i can make better stuff at my house . The staff was very rude and the bathroom was dirty and had no towels,0
"Very disappointed with my last visit to this bakery which is really sad given I live nearby. I ordered the coq au vin soup which i was told was a hearty chicken soup, the croissant sandwich with ham and cheese as well as a fruit tart. The cup of soup had absolutely no pieces of chicken in it, just a lot of broth and onions. The croissant was a mess, one side was not the entire croissant, seems most of it felt out or got burned so removed. The only thing that was good was the fruit tart as always. As I ordered all to-go, I didn't noticed all this until I got home which was extremely irritating. And this is not a cheap place!",0
This place is overrated! I would rather do Starbucks! The pastries are too pricey and taste stale. Coffee is disgusting! I have tried almost every kind of coffee here and nothing tastes good. The menu is written in unreadable text and the worker doesn't want to help you choose anything and always refer to the menu!,0
"I love this place, so it is hard to write a bad review. It was only my second time going to Amelie's. I have finals this week so I have already been once. Today, I had been there about an hour studying for my final, and a lady was complaining that the meeting room that she scheduled for her group was too small so, we were kicked out of our ""first come first serve"" room. People were complaining about this and not one of the staff members said sorry for what happened. There were no other open tables to sit at, and Amelie's wouldn't open up her original meeting room for us, so we were forced to leave. In the rain I must add. Amelie's, I had higher expectations for you. Obviously your ""regular"" customers that were in the room with me don't come first. Sorry but definitely won't be going there to sit and study. Maybe I will go to Starbucks or Panera where I know I won't be forced to leave.",0
"In a nut shell, I am a vegan and amelies offers no vegan options... Having said that, I live extremely close to amelies and have visited the bakery several times when friends and family are around. On my visits I do politely ask if there are any vegan options that they offer and usually I get a friendly no,... however the last time I went the person behind the counter was so utterly rude about it it makes me not want to visit this place. I understand my dietary needs are a choice and by no means to I expect everyone to conform to them, but I don't think it's appropriate when a suggestive question is posed that they be rude about it. I'm just sayin! ;) In other news... if you know of any places that have vegan dessert options (other than zizis) lemme know, as I've got a wicked sweet tooth!!!",0
"What a let down- it is 24 hours but the Salted caramel brownie was the only star worthy item I tried. No one in my party liked any of the pastries or tarts, they were bland and the texture was off. In fact, one of them sat in our hotel room, one bite taken, never to be finished becasue we were so disappointed with the pastry quality...Not worth the calorie splurge",0
"I tried the raspberry cake and the cream cheese puffs. I was very underwhelmed. The cake lacked flavor and was very bland. The cheese puffs while ok were not like ""omg I have to have!"" I actually drove quite a ways to get to this place because I read that it was open 24hrs. Maybe the desserts taste better when you are drunk or you are a college student who typically lives off ramen. This seemed to be the type of crowd attracted to the place. It is a very eclectic-urban type place. Very artsy. While that does not bother me, I did not like how the location is right next to a club. Not at all a place that I will come back to. Le Madeleine is 100 times better sadly.",0
"The service is such shit, no matter how many new people they hire, I assume, since it's different staff everytime I'm here. Literally everytime I'm here they fuck up my drink order, and all I get is fucking milk. A glass of milk which they ask if I want in a glass or or plastic cup. I always say glass, and get plastic. Like Jesus fuck I'm posting this from your bakery because it has just happened again. And the pistachio macaroons are hard as fucking rocks.",0
"very lack luster, whats the big deal ?? The ""buttercream frosting"" and I use that term LOOSELY ! is more like crisco cream frosting, and lets forget about the salted carmel brownies, they are NOT what they use to be :( sorry Amelies, I wont go back ,, I will stick with Novas Bakeries in Charlotte",0
Im not sure what the fuss is all about with this place. The coffee is marginal and the baked goods... almost as good as the coffee.,0
"I recently move back to Charlotte from Atlanta for grad school and was happy that they had an Amelies here, but It must be the ambience and the fact that they open 24hrs that keeps me coming here because honestly the food is overpriced, overrated and most importantly, the INTERNET NEVER WORKS!! when I'm here.....EVER! i have to put my hotspot on. I'm done coming here. I am a big fan of coffee shops. I come here to do homework because when i stay home i don't get as much work done as i will at a coffee shop, but yesterday was my last time coming here and spending over $15 for a drink and small pastries that looks like sample sizes. I was taking an exam and the internet failed on me. WTF! this is my first ever review. Get it together.",0
"The worst service ever , the food was not bad but the attitude of the manger ""moe"" is awful, she is totally out of place with her actions and the way she treats and talks down to customers. just plan rude. A paying customer deserves respect . maybe she should fine a different line of work!",0
"This place did not live up to the hype. Amelie's is overpriced and food is so-so. The croissant was cold, the soup was extremely pricey, and the sandwich had zero taste. The only thing I didn't try was something from the dessert menu. I tried to get something, but they said they ran out. Now I'm not an expert baker or anything, but seeing how this is a bakery, why couldn't they just BAKE another dessert for me. The atmosphere was nice, but compares nothing to going to a real BAKERY in a place like NYC. And having free WIFI is great, but Panera Bread has that too, and at that, so does my house. 2 stars for this place.",0
"Cool place. Good food. Really bad service. We've been here 6 - 8 times, and we've never experienced even decent service. We keep going back, because we really like the atmosphere and the food - but I think we're done giving it more chances. The employees behind the counter all seem completely miserable to be working there, and attitudes towards customers reflect that. During our most recent visit, I walked out after standing and waiting at the drink counter for 5 minutes for a drink refill ... and there were 2 people working this area with no other customers. They were just completely oblivious.",0
"Great for the Charlotte area and those who are not French.... However, the authenticity lacks actual french cuisine.",0
"I came here today for breakfast hoping to get some of their delicious quiche but they were out. Instead I got a sausage egg and cheddar sandwich on a croissant. I was informed it was 75 cents extra for them to scramble the egg, which I thought was pretty ridiculous. The total cost of my sandwich and small coffee was almost 8 dollars which is quite a bit more than what I pay at other places around town. When I got my sandwich it was pretty small and the croissant was so dry that when I bit into it it fell apart into flakes on the plate and was impossible to eat. Very disappointed in this experience overall. I did mention this to one of the workers and he did offer to get me something else so that is appreciated but I think they need to make a few changes with their breakfast sandwiches.",0
"When I went to the bakery, it was very cute and a well put together atmosphere. However I found that the croissant that I ordered was dry and hard like it was left over. It was also overpriced. I went back a second time to give it a second chance and ordered something else and was stiff stale/old and overpriced. Not worth the money!!",0
"Don't get me wrong, this is better than most places in Charlotte in terms of bakeries/cafes for atmosphere, but the food and pastries are good at best. The Croque Monsier was greasy and smelled like it was burnt in a toaster oven. The apple tart crust was so tough that I could barely cut it, and the French macaroon was as hard as a rock. I could do a better job with an Easy Bake Oven. The staff here isn't much better. Everyone treats you as though they're doing them you a favor. It's a cool place in terms of the decor, but the food and staff are truly lacking. The search continues......",0
"As a European Expat living in Charlotte, I can tell you this isn't a French bakery, not even close!!! It is Southern standards which mean it is sweet sweet sweet and nothing else! Bleugh! Don't waste your time or money on eating nothing but sugar.... Dumpy atmosphere as well.",0
"I'll begin by saying I love Amelies. It's a treat when I get to go, but Sunday night at around 2:30 a.m. was different. My husband and I ordered 5 different pastries for us and our children and 2 sandwiches. We waited a while for our sandwhiches...no big deal. Then we see a man take our sandwiches to the wrong person and get upset. I tried to tell him they were ours but he brushed passed me ignoring me. It was obvious he was upset. He threw our food down behind the counter and started angrily throwing them into to go boxes. I had a side salad and he slammed it around until half the salad fell out of the bowl. Another lady had to remake the salad. My husband yelled at him to stop being so rough with our food but he ignored my husband. He tried to give our food away again to the same guy but then calmed down enough to hear it was ours. He was like ""I'm sorry man"". I was so disappointed in the entire experience. I also drive for Uber and recommend Amelies to numerous out of town guests. I probably won't anymore if they risk being treated that way. No matter how successful a business is, they should always treat their customers with more respect.",0
"I've been to Amelie's a handful of times, and I'm sad to report I don't like it. I DO love the decor, and I DO love the assortment of desserts and pastries. Here's what I don't like: the place is always crowded and the food and espresso drinks are overpriced. I paid about $4.50 for a small latte (which costs less than $3 most other places). The woman at the register was in a foul mood and was very short with me when I asked for skim milk. Apparently, they don't have skim milk, only soy. The latte was not good (I threw it away on my way out the door). I've had the croque monsieur, which was extremely greasy, and the turkey and brie sandwich wasn't great either. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in Charlotte who doesn't like their salted caramel brownies (how can they call that thing a brownie, anyway?!). About half of the staff members I've interacted with were down-to-earth pleasant individuals, the others were haughty and downright snotty. 50% is not good enough in my book.",0
"I have a love/hate relationship with Amelie's. I love that the are open 24 hours a day, that is a gift for students and business people alike. However, they are overrated and because they are so popular they can do whatever they want, and they practice this power constantly. Sell frozen desserts. CHECK. Sell old desserts CHECK. Have staff that doesn't care or try. CHECK CHECK. I hate giving business to a place that has gotten too big and too snobby but man, you cant beat those hours.",0
"I've always liked Amelie's pastries and had been many times before, so when it came time to plan my sister's bridal party, I ordered a couple of trays ahead to pick up the morning of the brunch. The manager who took my order was very polite and helpful. When I arrived, however - half an hour after the time I was promised they'd be ready - the sandwiches evidently weren't even prepared. When I pointed out that I'd been promised trays, not bags, the reply was that ""Nobody told them that."" though everything was fixed, I was disappointed In the extra trouble in an already stressful wedding weekend.",0
"I usually do not write reviews, but after having the experience I had with this company, i just had to share. Amelies's is one of the most unprofessional companies I have ever seen. Let me explain why. I am having a wedding this August, so my fiancÃ© contacted the company asking about wedding cakes. The email reply she received was very vague, and stating that we need to pay $15 to receive a tasting box. We could have a consultation after receiving the box. They did not tell my fiance' that we can not pay at the store. So my fiancÃ© wrote them back an email saying they should have told her that she could not pay at the store to receive the cake. They went on to make her feel like she was the one at fault and that she should have already known that they only take payment over the phone with a card for the tasting box. How are your customers supposed to know this information if you do not tell them?? If we can not pay at the store, then you should probably tell us this in the initial email. So after we pay for the cake sample box, we go to the store to pick it up and then after trying the cake, my fiance' wrote them another email to set up a consultation. So they only do consultations during normal business hours, which is fine. It is now Tuesday and we told Betonya that we could meet Friday after 2p and she emailed us back setting the meeting time at 3p. So we get to the store at 3p and ask for Betonya, The gentleman behind the counter goes to the back and comes back up front saying that she was not there today. We told him she set a meeting for us at 3p. He was nice and went back to find out what was going on. He came back and said that she was not feeling well so she is not here today. So did Betonya not find the courtesy to let us know that she was not going to be in today, or at least let someone know that we are coming? We live 45 minutes away from the store and to come to an appointment set by the company and then being stood up is very unprofessional. After telling the gentleman that we drove 45 minutes to get there and she had set the date and time, he went back again and came out with two ladies. They were going to do the consultation for us but said they would have to relay the information we talked about to Betonya before letting us know anything. We did the consultation with them and left. My major concern is the unprofessionalism displayed by Betonya by not informing her customers that she set a time up with that she would need to reschedule. Very disappointed with this experience. For this reason, I will not return, and will tell everyone I know about this awful experience.",0
Over a short period of time this place has gone to the dogs. Napoleons and other butter cream pastries are now frozen as a matter of course. Beverage selection is poor and badly made coffee is accepted. Hipsters seem to accept the off hand service and lack of attention to detail as a badge of honor. Sadly the hype has done Amelie's a great disservice. I hope they can remedy it I used to love the place.,0
"Took my husband, who is from Egypt, here and then ordered a birthday cake and salted caramel brownies for his birthday. I spent 101.00. We were going to celebrAte with my family however the floods came and we could not meet. So my husband and I celebrated together and when we cut into the cake it was so dry that we could only eat the chocolate mousse and ganache. I decided to call this bakery to see what their policy was. I was told that they had 2 new bakers and maybe the simple syrup didn't get put on my cake. The manager said come by anytime and they would let me choose what I wanted. I called 2 weeks later and was told by another manager that they had made me another cake like the first one but I didn't come get it so they cut it and gave it away. I told her I was never told this and didn't know. She asked me how many people and asked me what I wanted. I said 8 and the small cake,like the large one I ordered, would be fine and the salted caramel brownies and gluten free ones for my daughter. She said fine I'll have it all ready for you. I could not believe that I was given 3 small cakes and some kind of small squares and 4 brownies and she said you can cut the small cakes in half.Needless to say I went to Publix, bought a 24.00 cake and my husband, my family and the waitress loved it.",0
"I was pointed in the direction of Amelie's by a classmate who seemed to be a fan of the breakfast sandwiches, which he said were usually sold out if you don't get there early enough. I figured this was a sign that it was a good cafe/bakery. The first couple times I went, I bought an assortment of pastries to try - most were pretty great. I had given some to my parents to taste and my mother insisted her birthday cake come from there (I live 90 minutes away so this wasn't exactly easy planning.) On my next trip I purchased several french macarons and after getting them home, discovered a small hair sandwiched into 1 of them. I emailed Amelie's through facebook to explain what happened just to let them know someone needed to be a little more careful. I received an email back from Lynn profusely apologizing (including the same formatted apologies I've seen from her in response to some reviews on here) and offering to make up for the mishap. She gave me a separate email address to contact her with additional information. I emailed her back at the address she provided and told her I didn't want anything for free (I assumed the apology and promise to check their procedures was sincere) - and only wanted some help picking out a birthday cake for my mom as I was short on time. I never received any response. I followed up a few days later on facebook to see if she got my email and again, no response. I sent a 3rd and final email December 26th (3 months after the fact) and finally got a response 8 days later apologizing for dropping the ball and offering a gift card to make up for it. I received another email this morning because she forgot to copy the gift card person on what happened. Really? This is a comedy of errors that just isn't all that funny so I won't be back.",0
"maybe the pastries are good but the service is shit, the coffee sucks and the service is shit. and its in the middle of nowhere.",0
"This was my go to place for breakfast everyday when I was visiting Vegas for few days. I really love their coffee and pastries! On the last day of my stay, I went there to pick up some macarons to bring home and as usual there was a long line. I really didn't mind to wait. When I got back to the hotel room which was upstairs, I quickly realized one of the macarons was not what I ordered. And i was also being charged for extra macaron on the receipt. I went downstairs again and told the lady at the shop about that. She raised her voice and said that's what I ordered. I further explained maybe because I was wearing a mask and it was loud in the surrounding (inside a hotel and casino and there were many people), she may not heard it right. But I would like to exchange to the one I wanted. She gave me such a dirty look and was continuing accused me that's what I ordered. I politely told her I would like to make it right to what I have ordered. I further explained I was being charged extra and she looked at me like I took my macaron out and came back demanding for the refund for ONE macaron?! Making it in a scene and everyone in line was looking at me! Really? This is the most ridiculous thing I ever experienced in a cafe like that!",0
"This placed should be called Karen bakery. Everyone is so rude and have major attitude. If you hate your job, choose a different profession.",0
"This is for the location by the escalator-to go only. Shame on Venetian/Thomas Keller to hire such rude people. We waited in line and the place one orders is before you get to the other food ""showcase"" around the corner. My wife and I told the employee that asked for order to hand on, we want to see the 2nd case. When we came back around to order, she RUDELY and obnoxiously told us not to cut into line and go back to the end f the line. Thankfully, the couple behind said we were ahead of them and to let us order. We put in our order and received our order, less an ice brew coffee. I simply asked were were missing a coffee and again we were rudely told they are out of coffee and making some more and to be patient. Could there not be a better way of saying that? RUINED the entire experience to have a coffee and pastry.",0
"So excited to try their pastries for breakfast and got up at 5:30. So disappointed i order almond chocolate croissants and it was dry and heavy. I think it was over baked. I stood in line for 15 min and spent $20 for fruit, croissants. They looked flat when i ordered but hoped looks were delicious .",0
"How is possible with a French name Bouchon have such a terrible croissant..??! Should have believed the Yelper who wrote that the pastries were staled and the bakery wasn't good. We bought two croissants at 10:45am, one was almond the other was apple. Those were probably the worst croissants we ever had. They were so dry that they were coming apart like a crumbling cookie. That's just unacceptable for the name and the location. We didn't complain and didn't return them but probably should have... one bite and in the trash they go. Should have gone back to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria which had better selection and top of the line pastries. This review is for the bakery only. I'm sure the restaurant is a lot better.... I hope.",0
"Mediocre quality for prices that are way too much. All drinks were 13 and above! Ham, egg and cheese was the highlight of the meal!",0
Asked for a hot Mocha and received a warm cup of dirty water. Do you know mocha is another word for chocolate? Blueberry muffins were good but I needed a cup of coffee. Did not go back again in our 6 night stay.,0
"Almond Croissant - It was hard and over baked. I had huge hopes but was very disappointed. This must be fluke, must be a one time mistake because I saw a picture of one of their half eaten croissants with airy hole pockets. But if they had messed up a batch, why not just throw it out? Where is the quality control? It really is not worth tainting their brand name.",0
"Ordered an almond croissant, two cheese danishes, and one small coffee in the morning we checked out of the Venetian. The almond croissant was like taking a bite into dry, two-week old cracker. Took one bite and trashed it. Did not taste fresh at all. Would not recommend. The cheese danishes were alright. At least there was cheese on top of the danish to combat the dryness of the bread. Was able to stomach these at least. Also had a coffee. Good coffee... but would be even better if they put it in a cup that didn't leak! See picture. Very disappointing. Not a great way to start of the long drive back to California...",0
i had been to bouchon before and loved it. this visit...not so much. almond croissant had very little filling and was just so-so. coffee also ho-hum.,0
"Bought ~$70 worth of coffee and pastries. For Bouchon's brand and pricing of products, I would expect service to be with the brand. There was nothing special when it came to their service. Felt like fast food type - got your orders, pushed food products out. No smiles or warmth of service. Sad coz I was very excited about experiencing Bouchon. If first impressions last, sad that this was my first impression.",0
"Food: almond croissant. Since we went at 3pm, it was no longer fresh. Very dry and old tasting. They should have given it to us half price at that point - or better yet -- free! I didn't even finish mine. Time: Go first thing in the morning when items are fresh. We wanted a snack around 3pm and almost nothing was left. Ambiance: tiny with one glass case display. No indoor seating. You can get your food and then walk outside to their outdoor patio seating and watch the weirdos walk by on LV Blvd. Service: the gal helping us looked bored/tired. Location: Clock tower next door to Walgreens. Tip: get your drinks at Walgreens next door!",0
"Extremely un-impressed. I did the bakery side for a quick bite and coffee. There was one person in front of me and no one after me so I thought this would be a breeze, not. I ask for a warm croissant and an iced latte. I was given the croissant cold and waited for my latte. The staff was chatting away without making any drinks and there was no one else in there so I was confused as to why my lattes was taken so long. Although the staff could clearly see me waiting no one asked me about it. Finally I asked about my latte and turns out they didn't know anything about it. Although the person who rang me up was friendly everyone just seemed very inattentive. I can't imagine coming here during a busy time if it was this bad with no one else there. As far as the food goes, the display case really didn't seem so appetizing and just very common over all. Nothing about the croissant or coffee stood out. I expected more honestly.",0
"If this is what you called service than I guess I should never have tipped! The service is definitely hit-and-miss at this location. I am a regular here when I stay at the Venetian. the cashier was taking my order and in the middle of my order taking she turned over to the two baristas asking/discussing about something - possibly about an order she took for the person in front of me. FINE! She continues to take my order. I asked ""is your latte sweet?"" She said no. So I said, ""great, I will take a large iced latte. I will also have an iced tea, easy on the ice, please. And a double shots of espresso."" Got my order. I was a bit confused why I got a hot latte opposed to an iced latte. So I told the barista (as seen in the photo) that I ordered an iced latte. OMG... here comes the condescending remark - ""well, did you tell her that?"" With her big eyes eyeballing at me. I responded, ""yes I did."" The barista turned around asking/telling the cashier. The cashier came toward me telling me, ""you told me you wanted iced coffee, you said latte, you didn't say ""iced"" latte."" I responded, ""first, I asked you if the latte was sweet or not"", you said unsweetened and that's when I said ""I'd like an iced latte"". I also said ""iced tea, easy on the iced."" (me: thinking to myself, how many times do I have to say ""iced""???)... mine you, they are not even busy. After speaking with the cashier, she took away the hot latte and she told to the barista, ""just make a new one"". The barista took the hot latte and threw it right in the trash with FAT CHIP ON HER SHOULDER as if the world is coming to an end and that she needs to sacrifice her life to make me an iced latte! well, maybe I was exaggerating, but seriously, that was the attitude I got! I mean, gesh... She could just put the ice in a new cup and pour the hot latte over. I would have been fine.... but no, she wants to make it even harder on herself.",0
"Worst experience ever. I ordered a dozen macaroons which was over $40 only to see the person behind the counter grab the display box and some sanitizer wipes from underneath the counter and go in the back room. When she came back out I asked her what she did with the wipes and the box that she put out macaroons in. She said that she wiped down the box and the plastic container because they ran out of boxes! As a customer that just spent over $70 on pastries the least I expect is a new box and not having to worry about whether or not I'm ingesting cleaning chemicals! This is an embarrassment! Tom Keller train your employees to have some common sense! On top of that when we asked for 3 cups of ice water the employee told us they are normally 50 cents each! Really, I just spent $70 on some pastries, you can't give me water? I'm surprised they didn't charge me for each napkin!",0
"Bouchon Bakery is a classic tourist trap in the Venetian on the Vegas Strip. I came to Bouchon Bakery one other time a year or two ago and the experience was so forgettable that I don't remember what I ordered or ate. This time, they won't be so lucky. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant ($6.94) and requested it warm. Their version of ""warming up"" a croissant sandwich is apparently putting it in the microwave without actually turning the microwave on. Whatever treatment they gave it resulted in a ""smooshy"" and sad-looking croissant, but one with a decidedly cold filling. The ham was of the normal sliced deli variety. Despite being billed as containing dijon mustard, I couldn't taste any mustard. My eagerly-anticipated croissant ended up being nothing more than an unfortunate waste of emmenthaler cheese, and a waste of $7. I would have had a more satisfying croissant sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts. I also ordered the kouign amann ($4.16), which was not as bad, but also no better than the kouign amanns I get at bakery-chain Paris Baguette in San Diego for half the price. Rather than being rich and buttery, with a cake-like consistency, Bouchon's kouign amann simply tastes and feels like a large croissant with a caramelized top (or bottom, depending on how you plate your kouign amanns). My pastries were accompanied by an iced latte ($5.32) that was poorly conceived and negligently put together, with my syrup of choice fully sinking to the bottom of the cup before I could even take my first sip. Middling chains from Starbuck's to Panera Bread to Coffee Bean have solved for this by using thinner, more soluble syrups, why can't Bouchon Bakery? Anyway. Shame on you, Chef Keller. Understand that when you put your name on an establishment that serves food, your customers reasonably expect that establishment to represent your culinary ideals and perspective, regardless of whether or not you're directly overseeing the operation or engineering the menu. Your name has value, and people are willing to pay extra for that given your well-earned reputation. I have to believe that if one of your pastry chefs ever tried to serve anything of the quality I've had at Bouchon Bakery to your customers at French Laundry or Per Se, you'd fire him or her immediately for gross incompetence. Do the right thing and put this abomination of a bakery out of its misery -- your reputation is at stake. Food/DÃ©cor/Service: 1.2/3.3/NA",0
"Waste of money, the only good thing going for them is the location which brings in tourists. *raises hand* Like me. First of all it was my first Kouign Amann ($7.50) experience ever, and omg. It was as hard as a rock from the outer crisp caramelized layer to the inside of it which is suppose to be rich/buttery and cake like. Such a disappointment. Also decided to try their macarons; a vanilla and a pistachio ($3.50ea) Honestly the most expensive macarons I've ever got, and I wouldn't have minded the price if it was worth it. Shell was sad and filling was overly sweet. Overall mediocre macarons with a price tag that only Laduree should have. Don't waste your time coming here. Hopefully you read this review before you make another one like it!",0
"I have only tried their giant macaron; unfortunately, the raspberry filling was way too sweet for my taste buds.",0
Came here at 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon. Ordered 2 ham and cheese croissants and a cold brew. Asked for the croissants warm-- just took a bite and they're both ice cold. Very disappointed. Would be fantastic had they been warm. You should know the proper cook temperature for your baked goods or hire people that care about the food they're preparing. Will not come back to the bakery.,0
"I do love the Bouchon Bakery macaroons. However what I did not enjoy/love was watching the young lady start to package the ones I ordered and not change her gloves after handling the other pastries. I did ask her to do so, she did but then apparently proceeded to package the wrong macaroons. I did not notice until I opened the box to enjoy during the drive home. Management: please educate your team about cross contamination as well as double checking orders to make sure the correct orders are being gathered.",0
"After eating an amazing meal at Bouchon, I was excited to grab a snack from Bouchon Bakery a few days later. I was actually hoping to try Thomas Keller's variation on the Oreo, but they were completely sold out, so I instead went with the old standby of an almond croissant. It certainly looked the part; it was covered in almond slivers and dusted with icing sugar. But one bite let me know that things had gone very, very awry somewhere along the line. Basically, the thing was hard as a rock. I couldn't even bite through it with my front teeth. I had to break off a piece and gnaw on it with my molars. Not exactly what you're looking for in a croissant. The middle section was a little better, as underneath the rock-hard exterior was a filling that was pretty tasty. But getting there required a Herculean feat of chewing.",0
I found this bakery highly overrated. We bought three items and each was beyond stale. Gave an extra as they refunded our money with no hesitation. They had to realize how stale they were when we bought them.,0
"This pains me to give Bouchon this review and I really hoped it was going to be higher as I had such high hopes! I lived in Paris for a while and love a great croissant in the morning. I heard there was a bouchon here and thought I'd try it. I also heard they have good macarons so thought I'd give that a go as well. If you like really good croissants, don't get there's. Honestly, it tasted like a day old croissant from Costco. Not that there isn't a place for those, but it isn't at an extremely reputable patisserie. More disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron. It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I can't decide whether I should finish eating it or not. If you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldn't be crunchy at all, not hard, but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it. This macaron, again, tastes a day old, it's hard,crunchy, and too cold. If you haven't had a macaron before, don't have this one or else you'll think macarons themselves are disappointing. The flavor is ok, however. Verdict: if you like real authentic croissants and macarons, dont come here. Tant pis...",0
Went early and hoping for freshly baked pastries however the pastries were cold and tasted day old.,0
"Terrible, I know 5th graders who make better grilled cheese sandwiches than these guys. Thomas Keller needs to get down here and go Hell's Kitchen on these people.",0
"Beignets were chewy with too sweet a cherry filling that overpowered the dough. The danish fruit pastry was crispy and flaky but there was a noticeable lack of fruit. I ordered a Dry Cappucino and it came out like a latte. I was so excited to try Bouchon, but became disappointed. The staff was friendly and very helpful.",0
"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. We walk in at 6:30pm after 20 min walk to this $hithole of a place only to have their lone employee say ""this is all we have"" when we see 20 pieces of paltry pastries. We ask for coffee and she satisfyingly says ""we don't have that either"" as if thats satisfying to her. Mind you this business says they are open until 9pm and coffee is their main staple yet they are out at 6:30pm and pastry counter looks abysmally empty. Word to Bouchon ownership: Learn how to run a business , you do not belong in a world class hotel like the Venetian when you can't even keep your main product stocked for customers nearly 3 hours before your closing time. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.",0
"I was excited to try the place. I've been to Bouchon (restaurant) and it was a good experience. I was hoping that the bakery was as good. We got some macaroons and a croissant. I expected better especially for the price. The macaroon fillings were too sweet. The croissant was cold and not flaky. It was just a bit better than the ones you get from Costco. Therefore, it wasn't worth the price. You can almost get a whole box of croissants at Costco for one croissant here.",0
"The bread was good, as was the sandwich, however took an extremely long time for a toasted sandwich, and we wanted to get a baguette to take back down to our hotel, but wanted it cut in half to fit in backpack, they said they couldn't cut it in half cause the knife is only for sandwiches.....ok so you can cut the bread for sandwiches with your knife but not bread the customer is buying? What bakery doesn't cut the bread for you?",0
"I was in Vegas for six days and passed this bakery's kiosk multiple times a day as I went to and from my room. My plan was to pick some up before my flight home. On my departure day I was unexpectedly running late but MADE time to run by. Luckily no one was there at the time I arrived. So I asked the lady working the kiosk some questions about the croissants ,but she looked completely annoyed (first experience with bad service in Las Vegas) the I ordered two of the Oreo cookie sandwich things and asked her to box them because I would be taking them aboard my flight. When I got home that evening I excitedly opened the box to present the two Oreos to my two boys at home....and was horrified to see it was only 1.33 cookies!!! Ugh!",0
"This location in Las Vegas is not up to par to the one in NYC. The 2 stars is for service and quality of the macaron and croissant. First, it was obvious I was next in line and the counter girl took the guy behind me. There were 3 other workers milling around; either inside the kitchen or doing inventory. None of them acknowledged me even with my irritated face. Finally one of the workers asked what I wanted. The macaron was cold; meaning it was not fresh. I also got the almond croissant; if I've known this before hand I would've never wasted my money. Again, it was not fresh; it was dry and lacked almond cream filling. The vanilla macaron that I usually get at Bouchon's in Columbus Circle is so fresh, decadent and service is great! If Thomas Keller knew about the quality of the products that they're serving here, he would be appalled! Two wrongs will never make a right! Service sucks and so do their products. Shame on you!",0
"After trying what is supposedly the best of the best macaroons, I've finally realized that I don't like them very much at all. I always thought that it was because I had not found one that was good. Everyone talks about Bouchon like it's the all mighty creator of macaroons. So I tried it, but for me, it was all hype. I tried every flavor they had available. Maybe it's the texture that I don't like. I expected something that was more crunchy or crispy. It just felt like chewed gum in my mouth. I am not saying that macaroons are bad in general, I'm just saying that they are not for me. My favorite was the chocolate one however. It tasted like a brownie. I wished I tried the other desserts. The red velvet cupcake was huge (twice the size of a regular cupcake) and it cost almost as much as one macaroon.",0
"Not too impressed. Their mocha was so-so, and the macarons are huge, but not quite up to par. We got: Pistachio: The pistachio flavor was good, but the cream inside was oily and not good at all. Vanilla: Fake vanilla taste, almost coconutty and not good at all. Coffee: Not bad, pretty normal. Overall, I would definitely rather go to other places (like Payard) for macarons, but I guess drinks are good enough.",0
"I am not crazy about this one, all the bread is too dry for me, not going to go again! The service is not good!",0
"This small little bakery is tucked underneath the staircase at the Venetian. My friend and I came across this shop when we were desperately looking for some coffee. We found it on Yelp, but got lost trying to find it. Bouchon offers a small variety of baked goods ranging from cookies to yogurt parfaits and cute macarons. We didn't order any of the baked goods but ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate. The drinks weren't anything spectacular; they scored below average for me. The hot chocolate was made out of milk but it tasted funcky. For Bouchon, I expected chocolate decadence, but I got none of that. The only good thing about the drink was the temperature because it was chilly and I depended on it to keep warm.",0
The baked items looked nice and tasted okay but they are on the same level as baked goods from Costco. I wouldn't recommend this place plan on coming back here. The coffee was okay too.,0
"The hot chocolate is not hot, it's less than warm and one of the staff said that I should have ordered extra hot. Seriously it's called hot chocolate for a reason. They remake the drink and it's its perfectly hot but it taste like warm milk. The macaroons are stale at 3.50 cents a piece. We ordered 5 we got one free, the vanilla was perfect and the rest are hard and chewy.",0
"Expect nothing better than an regular American, with worst attitude. No made to go, but warmed to go stuff.",0
"Made a quick stop in Bouchon Bakery as we we're walking around the Strip Suddenly a craving for a macaron was upon me & who am I to argue such a sugary-pull? Got the Pistachio & it was hard & chewy - no tender pillow of deliciousness. Disappointed Mr got the Banana Walnut Muffin & it was stale. Dry & tasted old, he threw over 1/2 of it away Maybe if we had been to the larger bakery inside the Venetian, we might have fared better, but this little kiosk at the clock tower has been neglected Sadness........",0
"So disappointing. The pain is chocolate and croissant beurre were overdone, a crumbly mess. Nothing at all like Paris or Montreal jean talon.",0
"It looks like I'm in the minority here, but I didn't think Bouchon's macarons were anything approaching good. They're large for sure, about the size of the palm of my hand and reasonably priced at $3.50 each. No creative flavors available - just the classics of chocolate, caramel, coffee, vanilla, pistachio & raspberry. The large cookie size meant that the ratio of shell to filling was way off (too much cookie) and my raspberry was a tad stale. Service was pretty crap too - the attendant couldn't have been more disinterested. Honestly, it's my fault - who buys a French pastry in an Italian-themed casino? Lesson learned.",0
"This incident happened around 9:30am Nov 29th Fri. I ordered several bakery items together with a sandwich. For the sandwich, they requested whether to be toasted, so I asked to do so. I paid about $45 and they immediately gave a bag. I just took the bag and came out the store and headed to my room at Palazzo. After 5 mins walking, I noticed that toasted sandwich might have been given to me together. I checked the bag and it was missing. This was fine since I also forgot to ask them. So I headed back to the store. I asked them whether it is ready, and they mentioned that it is still being toasted. It sounded strange since around 10mins already passed, but I waited in front of the counter. Then, I noticed that they actually forgot to put it in the oven and they were finding a sandwich and putting it in the oven at that time. We all make mistakes, but I was expecting apology at this point. The server didn't care about the wait or the mistake, so I became angry. So I requested for apology or any complimentary item. The server refused. I asked her whether I can talk to the manager. She said there is no manager, and he is upstairs. I asked her to call him then, but she said there is phone to call him. (which is I think is probably a lie). She said just go upstairs to talk to him. I wasn't happy about the attitude, so I asked her name several times. But she ignored my words. So I had no option but to take a picture of her since I don't have her name. (This was inappropriate behavior, so I have to apologize.) I didn't want to waste my time visiting upstairs, so I just came back. But I did have her name on the receipt. HEATHER. The manager of the store, if you happen to read this review and if she denies about the incident, then I should be able to send a picture of her. This was very bad experience for me and I wouldn't visit this store again.",0
"To be honest, it isn't the fault of Bouchon, but I thought that this would be a sit-down menu location instead of a small cramped express bakery with outside seating only. My group shared the turkey sandwich, chocolate croissant, and koign aman. Sandwich was average. Something that you could find anywhere . You can get it toasted though. The chocolate almond croissant was pretty good with a chocolate filling and crisp layers of pastry. The koign aman was new for me. We wanted to try something different but were extremely disappointed. It was a chewy sugary eggy bread that had a hint of salt. Nothing interesting or revolutionary. Wish I had gotten the pain aux rasin instead. For the price, go to somewhere much nicer and tastier.",0
There desserts were ok. The man kept on messing up our order and there service was horrible. The lady yelled when I asked her not to double bag the banana bread bc they were for two different family! She also said there are too many kids here and too much noise... then they tried to force us to take peppermint mocha for my daughter instead of hot chocolate! I just gave up! wow! Didn't realize bakery does not like the kids when they were the reason we came. If you wanted to get verbally abused while you pay for it then go there otherwise don't!,0
"My sister and I were in Vegas last weekend. I have to be honest and say this place was a let down. I'd read many reviews and looked over a lot of pics and got excited to try something sweet. The treats we bought did not live up to the expectations. We each got a macaron and croissant. The macaron tasted like it was stale. Like, the taste something gets when it's left in the fridge for too long and is an absorbent type food. I got the apple croissant and thought it was way too dry. My sister had the chocolate croissant and thought the same thing. It was kind of a pain to get to, so this is a spot I'll not waste time on next time I'm in town.",0
"The line here was shorter than the one I usually see back in Yountville, CA. - Croissant: not bad - Epi baguette: sadly stale - Chocolate almond croissant: consistent with the Yountville one in terms of having a nice generous base layer of frangipane and chocolate, and the almond crust on top was nice - Kouign amann: too buttery and sweet compared to some other ones I've had - Pistachio macaron: standard When we asked for butter and got Grassland whipped butter packs, it was disappointing. I wasn't expecting Animal Farm, but still. The line was also pretty disorganized, and they ended up charging us for a box of macarons (and giving us the box of macarons) in our large order when we never actually asked for it. When we brought it to their attention, they took it off, but it took multiple attempts to place orders for them to get our stuff right.",0
"Great pastries and coffee, abysmal service. 1. Ran out of iced coffee at 8:51 am. 2. Would not honor the 20% coupon we got from eating at Bouchon Bistro. We had a big fancy dinner and a big fancy brunch and dropped serious cash there (delicious and recommended), got a 20% coupon in return... And then found out they only honor it at the Clock Tower location. Which is garbage. 3. Forgot to include butter and jam with my friend's bread. 4. Generally slow and unorganized. I don't expect great service in Vegas but I do expect great service from any Thomas Keller establishment and was sorely disappointed.",0
"I was staying at the Palazzo and i saw on yelp there was a highly rated bakery next door at the Venetian. This location is right outside of the Grand Luxe cafe in the Venetian. I ordered the Vanilla Macaron, Almond Croissant, and Blueberry Muffin. The macaron was really big and really bad. It was cold, chewy, and i felt like i was eating something that sat in the refrigerator for a week. I took one bite and threw it in the trash. I eat Macarons all over the United States, and a normal macaron is room temp, not chewy, and usually has a nice soft texture to it. Avoid this Macaron at all costs. On a better note, the Almond Croissant was and Blueberry Muffin were both OK, but nothing to write home about.",0
"Extremely hard to find. It's located under an escalator at a dead-end area of the casino. Unless you walk all the way to the front door of the Venetian theater and turn around (it'll be behind you) then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it (like I did.) Another reviewer said it's near Lux Cafe...not really. It's a good bit away from it. The casino signs for it stop when you're still too far away to find it, and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it. I asked two - one sent me to the Lux Cafe bakery; the other tried to send me to the restaurant, which is located on another floor. Fairly pricy. Service was average; staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it. They got my order wrong, but fortunately I checked my bag, and they did fix it when I asked. But the biggest reason for 2 stars: Seriously underwhelming pastry. I ordered a macaron, TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo), a bouchon, a croissant, and a mini almond loaf, and coffee. The only things I would have ordered again are the coffee (not exceptional but good) and the almond loaf, which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh. The TKO was decent but too sweet - that white chocolate ganache didn't blow me away. I'm pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the TKO was not baked that same day. I went around 11 AM; perhaps things are better/fresher earlier?",0
"I was under-impressed with this place.... like really thought it sucked. I came down in the morning in my pj's and flipflops to grab some coffee before I started to get ready. After waiting in line for a good 10 mins, the girl informed me they don't take room key cards...FML I mutter. One star down. I tell her ""no worries"", I'll run upstairs and grab my wallet and be right back down. By the time everything is ready I'll be right here. I ordered a large latte and a chocolate almond croissant. I go upstairs, get my wallet, make it all the way back down and MUCH to my DISMAY she never submitted my order. I guess she needed to wait for me to come back. Minus another star...that's just bad customer service. Here's an idea...why don't you have signs that clearly say you don't take room keys to ""charge it to the room"" before people actually get in line? So now I have to wait, I'm hungover, sleepy, pissed, and impatient...not what you would call a ""happy camper"" and this has been a really shittie experience so far. I finally get my items and travel upstairs to my room. The croissant was drier than dry, it was quite awful really. IF it wasn't such a pain in the you know what I would've gone all the way downstairs to return it...it was THAT BAD. It was so dry that it actually broke apart into sawdust and went everywhere, like a vampire that just got staked. I even tried to flick it to see if it would disintegrate into a bunch of little pieces and it did. No Bueno I won't return and I would rec'd you head over to the food court for coffee. Really a disappointing experience all around.",0
"Stood in line. Seemed like a popular place. The pastries looked good. Got to the front and learned there was no coffee because the worker was too busy to make any. It was 8:30AM. I may be a tough reviewer, but I think a coffee shop should probably figure out how to have coffee at 8:30AM. So, the coffee and pastries may be great - I don't know because they didn't have any.",0
"Went there for an inexpensive afternoon snack. Outside seating is nice - although it is right by a bus stop and the main street. Previous reviews indicated that it was a little gem within expensive restaurants. I couldn't disagree more. The ham and cheese baguette I had was probably one of the worst I have ever had. It was old, dry and rubbery/chewy. They did however offer to toast my bitten into sandwich. Bouchon quality for me means freshly made to order sandwiches and not pre-made old ones from the morning. Very disappointed.",0
"I have been wanting to try this place forever, but I've avoiding it because like ever other local I hate the strip. I was in the Venetian, and accidentally ran into this little gem. I was unprepared, shocked, excited! I knew that I wanted to try the macaroons. At the $3.50 a pop, I could only justify getting one. I settled on my favorite flavor, pistachio, and ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well. The macaroon was overly sweet. To me it tasted like an Andes mint flavored macaroon, so maybe they use mint for color? There was only a subtle hint of pistachio. I was completely disappointed. The macaroons in the freezer section at Walmart are 10 times better. The chocolate chip cookie was okay. The chocolate chips were fantastic, but the cookie was just average. Definitely not something I'd go back for. If you're on the Strip, there are far better options that are more deserving of your money and caloric intake. Skip this one!",0
"1 star off: I stopped by this bakery around noon on a Thursday and there were no croissants left. Aren't croissants a staple of French bakeries? 1 star off: No apology... 1 star off: No indication of when they will have a new batch... Just that there were no more croissants. I looked at the display case and there were only a few macaron flavors left as well. I like the Bouchon Bakery in Napa a lot, so I wanted to try this location. I just wish this location is better stocked, especially with the items that make it unique. Otherwise, it is just like a Starbucks...",0
"This review is for the little Bouchon located under the escalator near the theatre. I stopped by here 3 times during the course of my stay at the Venetian. Five stars for the pastries, but one star for the poor service. Pastries: I tried the macaroons in salted caramel, coffee and pistachio and all were excellent. These are large, about 3x the size o a normal macaroon, and we're perfectly gooey in the center and crunchy on the outside. I also trie a croissant, which was flaky and light. Service: poor, sloppy, rude. My latte came out too hot and I could taste the burnt milk (I used to be a barista so I know they steamed it way over 140 degrees). When I asked them to redo it, the guy rolled his eyes, didn't acknowledge me and handed it back to the barista. No apologies that my overly expensive $6 latte tasted shitty. Also, they got my macaroon order wrong and I didn't find out till I flew home. Bouchon is a prestigious brand, and I'm surprised they'd hire bratty little teenagers or people with the service level of a McDonald's to represent their brand. No matter if it's the flagship restaurant or a little express location like this one, Bouchon should ensure consistency and quality in the experience of their brand.",0
"No, Bouchon Bakery, you do not get to charge so much for such mediocre pastries. I tried you over and over again out of proximity and necessity while I was here for CES, and while you occasionally satisfied, you almost always disappointed: Plain croissant - dry Almond croissant - exterior dry, interior too sweet Banana muffin - dry Turkey sandwich - decent Bouchons - decent Kouign Amann - good It's odd to me that Thomas Keller could let such substandard product go out day after day. Neither location in the Venetian seemed popular and the presentation is fairly poor, so I file the whole enterprise under a big why? We mixed up our Bouchon with sandwiches and pastries from the food court several times, and in all cases we did better there.",0
"This was a little kiosk behind the escalator. It doesn't offer any seating which seemed odd to me. We got green tea but I think they gave us Earl Gray. We also purchased a Buchon which is a brownie bite. Good service, reasonable prices for Vegas but no need to go back.",0
"Pretty mediocre food for the price. Would expect more than machine made coffee and espresso from a stall that advertises ""food fit for a king""",0
I'm sure everything taste good. But if you search gluten-free on yelp this bakery comes up. They have macaroons and yogurt only nothing else is gluten-free.,0
"""Meh. I've experienced better."" Was exactly my reaction. I've been to other locations and for some reason the macarons here tasted stale and the coffee was bleh. The macarons were a bit harder than I'm used to at their other locations, but still kept their iconic large size. I usually order the caramel and the chocolate covered chocolate.",0
Maybe I'm crazy but when I visit a bakery that has a lot of hype I expect a bakery... Not a pop up shop looking store front with a small selection of pastry . To bad because the enormous macrons were Scrumptious but not enough to have me stop by again . There wasn't any seating or anyone willing to help me find the correct bakery spot if there was it is .,0
"This is for the store next to the gift shop. Major operational screw up made a quick pick up turn into a 20- 30 minute wait for nothing. There was a couple of irate customers who did not receive receipts or their orders and held up the line. The staff could have just remade them the order and let the line move on. Instead they wasted so much time arguing and a big crowd was waiting. I was waiting for my ham and cheese croissant to be warmed so had no choice but to wait. And at the end, my croissant wasn't even warmed! Even if the food is good I will not come here again and ensure such bad service. They should fire the operations manager for the poor job.",0
Used to love this place for years. They used to have the best almonds chocolate croissants. Croissants ate still good but what happen to the service with a smile?! What's with the attitude?!,0
"I'm shocked everyone time I go to a Bouchon Bakery outside of Yountville. They are never good. Two stars just because it's located right by the elevators for the Venetian tower. But seriously, these places dilute the Bouchon brand :-(",0
My sister went to Vegas and bought me some of their macaroons. At $4 a piece she thought it would be very tasty... Unfortunately these were harder than rocks! When you take a bite it feels like you broke a part of your tooth off. The flavor is nothing special nothing tastes just same old same old. I definitely will not return to this establishment for macaroons.,0
"After a disappointing breakfast nearby, my mood was heightened at the reminder of this bakery nearby. I stood in line looking at all the bakery items on display. My eyes lowered a bit when I couldn't see my go to item in the case. Perhaps its in the back waiting to be replenished. My time came to order as I asked the gentleman did they have anymore sticky buns in the back. To which he said they no longer carry them. I cried a little bit inside, but at this moment I knew Vegas was no longer the city for me.",0
"I keep hearing things about Bouchon this and Bouchon that. There wasn't any money in the budget to eat at the actual Bouchon, so the bakery was the closest I could get to it. Loren John B. said they have the best doughnuts in America according to Yahoo! so we ventured out to the Venetain to check it out. They are located by the Phantom theatre. Sadly, by the time we got there, they were all sold out. This was at 11am. We opted for a TKO (their version of an oversized oreo), red velvet and chocolate cupcakes. I really liked the TKO; the filing was really good. As for the cupcakes here, NO. The red velvet tasted nothing like red velvet and they put regular ol cream cheese in the middle of the cupcake. The chocolate one was okay. I really want to know what the doughnuts taste like. Doughnut get the cupcakes.",0
"We heard a lot of positive things about Bouchon Bakery so we decided to trek to the Venetian, where Bouchon Bakery is located. Venetian and Palazzo is a one huge maze so my most useful tip would be that the bakery is located right next to the Grand Lux Cafe. We arrived and was gravely disappointed because the storefront resembled a kiosk, not unlike how a Starbucks is nestled at the local Target. We didn't know what to expect but we were def bummed out. They don't really have a dining area reserved exclusively for the bakery. We had to find a spot at the food court 30 yards away. We ordered latte and chocolate croissants. The coffee was no different from sambalatte but the croissants were not nearly as good. It was flaky and kinda dry. We prefer doughy and soft.",0
This place is hard to find. Anyway I was in the mood for some macaroons. My partner in crime is dessert fanatic so was game when I mentioned this place. Boy were we disappointed. He had a chocolate pie and I had 3 macaroon. Visually the macaroons looked appealing and the size was generous compared to other offering on the strip. Taste was too sweet (a lemon macaroon is not supposed to be sweet) The chocolate pie was just like eating a chocolate bar. And the prices were outrageous (2 espresso drinks + 1 dessert and 3 macaroons for total of 26$!) I think there are better offering on the strip so look elsewhere.,0
Latte was not good. Ordered 6:50 am on Nov 14. What more can I say. Being a barista varies quite a bit and it very much varies here today.,0
"Finally I had a chance to visit the Venetian. Since I was there, I wanted to try a macaron at the popular Bouchon Bakery. I went to the smaller cafe version on street level on the strip since I was very close. I had already decided on which pricey macaron to get, but no one still came to help me. I looked to my left and saw some of their young help in the back just chatting away. They looked at me, but didn't budge. I guess their conversation was much more important. I just left without anything.",0
"this review is strictly for this location. ( the one above Walgreens) My husband and i have been long time fans of bouchon bakery... so much that we have to stop by each time we leave. our must gets are usually the ham and cheese croissant and ham and cheese sandwich / turkey sandwich. This past weekend ( easter) , we stayed at the palazzo and walked to this tucked away location thinking we could beat the line. we got there and were the only ones there ...so here we were thinking yay we scored. The girl behind the counter did not greet us right away... not that it mattered if she was busy .. but she wasnt and when she did she was not very friendly. I placed my order of the ham and cheese croissant and waiting for it to be heated up. IN the meantime, my husband wanted to place an additional order but this girl was just ignoring him. It took almost like 2 minutes before she asked if he needed some help or if he wanted to order. yeah granted we came together, maybe that can be confusing, but i thought it was pretty obvious that he needed to place to order. Anyways, after 2 minutes she finally acknowledged that we wanted more sandwiches. Again she was not friendly, and almost borderline giving us an attitude. But we didnt say anything; we just stayed quiet and just waited patiently for our sandwiches. At the other locations, the staff normally would put the whole sandwich in the panini press but this girl... she took the sandwich apart and then heated it . it just seemed so different ... but the main reason for this review was b/c both my husband and i got food poisoning from these sandwiches we got . I dont know if its b/c of the location - that they may not get the most fresh items or if the assembly of these sandwiches went wrong. but for now .. im definitely staying away from bouchon. some may say .. maybe its something else we ate or drank that day ... but to make it simple, those sandwiches were the only thing we ate that day before we headed back home and water was the only thing we drank ( bottled). we are soo disappointed.",0
"I just came here for macarons. They are a good monetary value but the taste is just meh. Salted Caramel was a sugar bomb, too heavy, too sweet, too meh, 2/5 Pistachio was a little better, 3.5/5 They didn't taste very fresh.",0
"So very disappointing and not up to Bouchon standards! My family and I have been to Bouchon Bakery in Yountville California many many times, and this Las Vegas location is inferior. We are not quite sure why they aren't keeping up with quality control, but after going out of our way to get pastries there on our one day in Vegas, we felt obligated to write a review. We had butter croissants and almond croissants, and they were all stale and awful. They seemed to be day old at least. We have not only been to Bouchon Bakery many times in California, but we have also eaten at Bouchon Bistro in Yountville for various special occasions. We have never been disappointed there, and have always loved our meals. Perhaps the Bouchon Bakery in Vegas is under different ownership?",0
"Meh is just the word. We are Las Vegas locals. I have been here once before and had an OK experience then as well. The first time we came rather late, there was a very minimal selection. We chalked it up to how late in the evening we arrived. On our recent second visit we came at a decent time mid-day. It was the same scenario, barely a selection. The macaroons are OK. We got the Salted Caramel, Vanilla and Chocolate. One of them was really stale and hard to bite in unfortunately. The texture is on point, but sadly the taste just isn't there. They all tasted very similar, with not munch of difference in flavor. We also got the Chocolate and Vanilla eclair-(Pastry and what seems like just whipped cream in the middle). Also again very disappointing. I by no means a food snob. But I felt for the price and size, I was really missing out. The staff was friendly, however we were over charged by $10. There were quite a few people and they were busy. We didn't have a receipt (our mistake). So we just made a note to never come back. Real downer, but if I were you. I would spend my time and money elsewhere.",0
Awful desserts . The French macarons were super soft and Mushy! Overly sweet as well. I'm used to crunchy but chewy macarons. No one ate any of them I got. They went in the trash. The croissants were way too flaky. One bite and there was crumbs all over our floor. Flaky is definitely a good thing in croissants but this was way too much. This place is over rated. Tourist crowd it because they don't know any better.,0
These pastries aren't fresh. I'm from the Bay Area. I don't expect old soggy croissants from Bouchon.,0
There was no one in line before us and took over 10min for cappuccino and wasn't good. Had to toss it out.,0
"Biggest disappointment in Vegas was paying over $3 each for stale, hard macarons (and I had two different flavors, so it wasn't just one bad batch). The people working there were super friendly, but considering I walked a mile out of my way to try the macarons, I was really disappointed. Maybe I just caught them on a really off day, but these were some seriously bad macarons.",0
"They had more staff than the number of guests but yet still completely lost and had us waiting. This business doesn't even require actual cooking. How can this even be possible. Please have your staff trained properly and incase of getting your orders wrong or having your guest wait for ling, at least have them look at the guests and apologize properly",0
Five stars on the service and bakery! However their food is way too salty. I ordered the ham & cheddar omelette and the ham is the saltiest ham I've ever had in my life. This is way beyond the level of salt a human being can have for a day to stay healthy. And their mixed green salad on the side is also salty - due to their dressing. Just a warning.,0
"Rather ho hum assortment in the worst possible location. This has the Bouchon name on it, with inflated prices, and it is a glorified hole in the wall hidden underneath a staircase. It was an adventure just trying to find it and not in a good way.",0
"Service was horrible, acted like they were doing us a favor! Brought out butter and jelly and no bread for 15 min after we sat down... repetitively asked. No small plates for appetizer after asking for plates just sat down four plate for us to pass out. No detail on questions we were asking about menu... no coffee refills until asked...no spoon with soup , had to wait 3-4 min for them to bring one out after I had soup sitting in front of me. Orders brought out wrong and annoyed that we asked for it to be redone like we asked in first place. Will not be back",0
"Unfortunately Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian was a huge disappointment. It began with trying to find the small counter located in a most obscure location within the massive property of the Venetian Hotel. I felt so frustrated by the time we finally arrived and made a comment about the location to one of the many employees behind the counter. The young lady looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. She couldn't have cared less. Remember? This is a Thomas Keller experience and I guess I should have remembered that part. Once I made my selections I was passed over to the cashier, or was it one of the many other people behind the counter (they were literally bumping into one another because there were so many people behind the counter) where I repeated my order to her and cashed out. I had selected the ham and cheese on a baguette that was heated up for me and was good. No complaints. The bread was fresh and because it was heated had a nice crunch to it. I had also ordered several other products for the sake of this review and because having recently returned from a 3 month stay in France wanted to have the opportunity to make a fair comparison. Keep in mind my selections (with the exception of the TKO) are standard faire anywhere in France so in my mind the right selections for the sake of comparison. The almond croissant was so heavy (weight). As soon as I picked it up I knew it was nowhere close to an almond croissant one would find anywhere in France or any Stateside French bakery. It was FILLED with almond paste and there was no flakiness whatsoever to the pastry. I took a couple of bites and tossed it. I pulled the Financier from the bag and took a couple of bites of it and it too was just a big heavy something or other. I am not trying to sound like a snob but I have come to realize there are ""American"" French (sounds good) Bakeries and there are French Bakeries. This is definitely an American style French Bakery. The products are heavy, way too big in size and lack any ""French"" to them. So to wrap it up, I thought the employees made me feel like I was lucky to be at a Thomas Keller establishment. The location (or secret hiding place) of this particular ""kiosk"" or ""counter"" was ridiculous. And finally it is not a French Bakery but a bakery where you can pick up something that resembles a bakery item you would find in France or most French Bakeries Stateside. Sorry Thomas...just sayin'...",0
I tried Bouchon once in New York and it blowed my mind. The best hot chocolate I've ever tasted along with some pastries. This time I was so excited to try my best drink here at Las Vegas and very disappointed. It was just a watery chocolate drink. I can get way better satisfied one from Starbuck with cheaper price. So disappointed...why is it different quality under same name and same price?,0
"Okay, what the heck happened? This place used to be my go to place for a quick snack when I stayed at the Venetian. Now everything is mediocre at best. The macarons were stale and the croissant was meh. Very, very disappointing. Probably won't be coming here for a quick snack again.",0
"seriously, what is going on? i bought i'd give this location another try since the NYC location was awesome. we got jelly donut - ok carrot cake - good Kouign Amann - terrible, beyond terrible, mushy and too sweet blueberry croissant - terrible, also too sweet and mushy why is everything too sweet? and Viennoiseries are all soggy (costco quality). for the price we pay for, totally not worth it!",0
"Sadly I had to give this place two stars and that's only because the girls that were working on 3/5 at 1:43 had major attitudes! We ordered an iced coffee and we received a hot one. When we brought it up to their attention they seemed annoyed. However, the taste was great but they have a lot of improvement to do on their customer service",0
"The sign for a box of 6 assorted flavored macarons said $15. But I got charged $17.50. It's bad business to put up a sign for one price and overcharge it when my card is rung up. That's fraudulent sales practices. I won't be going back to get ripped off again...and no, the sales tax is not 16.67% in Vegas.",0
The pastries are a little stale. Had the chocolate eclair. The filling seemed a little too cold and the pastry lacked flavor. A bit of a line and wait to get the pastry unless you go early in the morning or in the afternoon. I would say not worth the money nor time required.,0
"If it is after 8am AVOID the food. After a long day of walking around we were looking forward to grabbing a nice cup of coffee and some pastries (around 3 pm). Grabbed pastries: Butter croissant, sticky bun and one of the giant macarons. Took bites of said pastries. Disgusted by dryness and staleness. Proceeded to feel very sad and disappointed. (Why bother having the bouchon trademark and serve stale goods?) Talked with girl who sold us pastries - after some discussion she refunded the order (at least there was that). So let's start with what was wrong. (-1) For having the dryest butter croissant. It looked soo good and flaky. But darn can looks be deceiving. (-1) For having the morning sticky bun that was made two mornings ago. They claimed these were baked fresh... but i've made sticky buns myself and they didn't taste that stale (the butter in the caramel had almost a rancid taste) even after days in the fridge. (-1) For macaron that was frozen, not properly thawed, and then produced to ice while still being ice-cold. The worker claimed they were ""Refrigerated"". Unless in the cooking world -8C is refrigeration, something is wrong. (+1) For the kind soul that refunded us the money. She seemed so lost and claimed thats how everything is ""supposed to taste"". Not sure if that's better or worse. Anywho: I dont even want to give them a second shot. #sadness.",0
"We all know about Bouchon-at least us Bay Area folks do, and this review is not for the food but for the ASS service and ASS latte i got here yesterday morning for the lovely price of $5.25. The bread is slamming, but seriously, learn to make a fucking decent latte. When someone asks for extra foam and you give them a latte with NO Foam and said person says I asked for foam and your reaction is to pour out 1/4 of the latte to ADD foam, you best realize you are pouring out the ESPRESSO I paid for. They were not happy that I told then to remake the whole thing, but for serious, learn to make a fucking latte. ***** Upping to 2.5 stars. Lovely husband went down this am and got a triple shot latte for me with extra foam and it was better, not great. Maybe it is because he is cuter than me!",0
"First: Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant NOT the bakery. My review is for the bakery. I have been coming here for years, but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just don't care any more. They seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners The coffee is good, but the pastry is where they need to re-focus. First, the biggest offender is their Macarons. They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week. This thing was seriously rock hard. They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior. That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie. When we complained they said ""that is the way they are supposed to be, and the softer ones are old"" No, no, they are not. You overcooked the crap out of these which formed, essentially, a meringue. I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself. I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree. I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them. Do not insult me by telling me this hammer-substitute is in any way acceptable. They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie. Astounding. The rest of the menu items have just gone downhill. Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets. The outside should be flakey and the inside tender. Not some glupey congealed mess. You know how I know its a terrible croissant? There was absolutely no flakes to clean up. I hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up.",0
"Anyone who says Bouchon has great macarons clearly does not know anything about macarons. I consider myself somewhat of a macaron connoisseur, having discovered them while living in Paris a few years ago. The macarons at Bouchon are horrible. They are overly big, too dense and chewy, and over-refrigerated. They were not fresh or delicate at all. Not even holding them to the lofty standard of Pierre HermÃ© or LadurÃ©e, they still pale in comparison to other places in NYC, San Fran, and Vancouver. We usually sit and savor every last crumb, but at Bouchon, we didn't even want to finish them. It was a chore. And way overpriced. The only reason it gets two stars is because the TKO (like an adult Oreo cookie) was good.",0
"Want in for breakfast bough cream cheese danish and coffee everything was just delicious, very next morning we want in for coffee and a Han and cheese crason Turkey baget ,crason tested fine but the turkey baget was unadable, we both agree it must have been sitting there from at least two days, don't serve people food you would not eat yourself, for 40.00 we could have a brakefest buffet at the Cesaers Hotel",0
"Damn you and your beautiful pastries. No, not because I can't stop eating them. But because I'm convinced that I keep ordering incorrectly, and surely something in that case is as delicious as it looks. Turns out, that's just not the situation at all here. You get a solid gold star for strong, delicious coffee, but I'm done handing over my hard earned cash for disappointing baked goods. They're just not good. The red velvet cupcake was dense, almost stale. The chocolate chip cookie was dry, dry, dry. Thanks, though, for the coffee.",0
"Heard really good things about Bouchon Bakery. I ordered: 1. Iced Hazelnut Latte : first off, did not taste any hazelnut. Espresso was burnt and tasted like shit. Couldn't even drink half of it. 2. Vanilla Macaron: these were HUGE, size of my palm. I was excited, then I bit into it... hard as a rock. Was very disappointed..I paid 3.50 for a macaron I expect it to be at least half decent. I guess I just expected more from this bakery. :( Would probably not come back for the macarons., or the coffee.",0
Tried one of the large raspberry macarons. It was subpar. It was crunchy and just didn't wow me. I had high hopes! :(,0
I wanted some good French baked goods and I was so disappointed. The croissant and the pain au chocolat had no crunch and honestly seemed like they were a day old. The coffee however was good but I don't recommend any of the baked goods there.,0
"Alright, because I wanted to find out what Bouchon bakery had to offer I decided to plead with my husband on heading over to the Venetian and grabbing some macarons. With much hesitation he finally agreed. This is going to be a short review but definitely to the point. 1. Chocolate Eclair: ugh. Disgusting. The chocolate filling was too bitter and it left that ""made yesterday"" taste. Which it probably was. 2. Macaron: I'm sorry, but macarons are not suppose to be more chewy than a stick of gum. And it was chewy. I lost faith in Bouchon's macarons here. I thought they may blow LaDuree or even 'Lette macarons out of the water but they did not. Even my husband (who's not big into sweets) even thought 'Lette macarons were good. 3. Carrot Cake Cookie: didn't taste bad, but I'd still settle for the Trader Joe's Karat cake. Will I come back? Most likely not. I don't think it's worth it. Thank goodness the restaurant is a whole other thing.",0
"I was rather disappointed with Bouchon! I read an article on Yahoo! that they had one of the best donuts in the country. Unfortunately, a few friends and I showed up here around one in the afternoon only to find out they sold out earlier in the morning. Laaaaaaaame. So, since we were there we might as well try something, right? Clarisse C. and Jeffrey L. purchased a red velvet cupcake, a chocolate cupcake with custard in the middle, and a TKO. The red velvet cupcake wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Jeff was really disappointed with it too. The chocolate cupcake wasn't much better, but a slight redemption from the red velvet. Among four of us, we all enjoyed the TKO, which was basically a fancy Oreo cookie. If I could suggest any delicacy, I'd say grab yourself a couple of those. Unitl I get around to trying the donuts, this review remains at 2-stars. That is all.",0
Ordered a chocolate croissant it was just ok. The hot chocolate was awful! Tastes like a water.,0
I'd rather go to Dunkin Donuts. This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
"stopped at coffee stand for cappuccino. coffee just average. Nothing special. Croissant tasted ""day old"". Sold out of ham and cheese croissants. Staff was clueless and inefficient. So I went over to restaurant to purchase items to go and stood at the bar for 10 minutes only to be ignored by the bar staff. I went to Bouchon's in Napa and it was wonderful. Won't be back here and I don't recommend either Bouchon's in Vegas. Disappointed!",0
"Only two stars, because the fact is that yes, I have experienced better than the pastries at the Las Vegas Bouchon Bakery. The best of what I sampled was the chocolate croissant: it had two ribbons of chocolate in it, which was quite nice. However, the pastry was just a bit too tough when it should have been tender, and it was too greasy. I also took tastes of four different macaron flavors: chocolate, vanilla, raspberry and lemon. The chocolate was far and away the best of the four, but it was more like a brownie than a macaron. The weakest were the raspberry and lemon, which had too much oozy filling. Worst of what I tried: the pain au raisin. Pain au raisin is supposed to be a custard raisin roll, not a raisin danish. Flat, extremely greasy... I will only grudgingly acknowledge that there were enough raisins and that they were soft and tender, but that couldn't salvage the thing. I don't know, maybe I'm holding this place to unfairly high standards, but I know that pastry can be better.",0
"I've heard a lot about Bouchon Bakery but it fell below my expectations. Maybe my expectations were too high??? I thought the pastries were nothing special and didn't make an impact on me. They weren't awful but not so memorable either. Red velvet cupcake - wasn't even red.. more like diluted washed out red. Cream cheese icing was good but there was too much of it. I liek my cupcakes moist but this wasn't. I've had way better red velvet cupcakes. Bread pudding cake - Presentation was great. Looking at it made me salivate. Tasting it however, was not so great. Dry and bland. Chocolate tart - great texture but the taste once again disappointed me. Some I can see why people would like this but it was way to rich for me. Everytime I took a bite it felt like it got stuck to the roof of my mouth. I want to eat chocolate... not peanut butter. I've been told their macrons are good but I didn't get a chance to try it. Maybe next time? I do want to try Bouchon Bistro though...",0
"Terrible and slow service. There was 5 total people in line and we waited 30 mins to get a latte and coffee. At least 4 people behind us got their drinks before us. When we asked what's taking so long, we simply got brushed off and the lady continued making her drink. Surprising, since we weren't rude and they seemed to be friendly to everyone else. What really sucks about this was we were in a hurry to get back to LA and what was suppose to be a quick coffee in a short line made us so late.",0
"Terrible customer service. Overpriced, mediocre food (at best). Stopped by about 10AM on a Sat for a snack and some juice. There were 6 people working behind the counter, and every one of them was dismissive and unfriendly. They all seemed as if they hated their jobs. I get that customer service can be a frustrating job, especially in food, but I expect to be treated with kindness and respect. After I ordered and paid, they forgot my food. I had to ask for it about 10 mins later. The bottled orange juice was good. The toasted turkey and cheese baguette was not. Dry. Cold. Tough. Disappointing. Maybe their coffee and espresso drinks are better, but I'll never stop by there again to find out.",0
"Bouchon. I really need to adjust my expectations accordingly because due to the hype, I always associated Bouchon with all things awesome and so far, all my experiences have bordered only OK to meh (my other experiences: Bouchon Bakery in NYC & Bouchon in Bev Hills). But I'm just mostly sad..the fool me once, fool me twice thing, now fooled me the third time!!! During our trip here for NYE2012, we had some time to kill before all the festivities and took a walk on the strip. I spotted Bouchon bakery and excitedly pointed out to my bestie that this place is suppose to have the BEST MACARONS! That got her all excited too so we picked up a pre-boxed of mini (6 for $12) to share a bunch of different flavors and bask in its glory. The first 3 out of the box were straight up stale. We wouldn't have realized it until we got to the last 3 and realized how much better tasting those were. At $2 for each dinky one, that is unacceptable. In the future, I would definitely question the pre-boxed stuff and ask how long it has been sitting there. The premium price tag should mean consistency. I am disappoint.",0
"Unlike the reviews posted hearer about this place. I was not impressed. Everything is extremely expensive here and of average or below quality. We had a chocolate eclair for 5 or so dollars that was dried out, and I am sort of okay with paying 11 dollars for a ham and cheese baguette if it is really good, but the cheese had dried out and the bread was stale. Not very impressed at all.",0
"Small bakery in the middle of the Venetian, behind the escalators going down around the Phantom Theater. After going to the Napa location numerous times, this one is sad to stop by and give 2 stars to =(. But they only had 4 types of macarons, service was kind of weird/awkward, and the cappuccino was not worth $4 (it was watered down/really weak). Chocolate almond croissant was dry. I'd only come back because the macarons taste the same, hopefully the Napa location opens back up soon!",0
Waited in line for 5 mins and the employee skipped over to serve someone else who just walked up. I looked at him and I'm next and i was ignored. Won't go to this establishment again. Thankfully another coffee shop is across the street,0
I'm sooo disappointed. I brought friends visiting from another country to experience the buttery masterpieces at Bouchon and was bitterly disappointed and embarrassed. The chocolate and almond crossiants I normally enjoy were dry and stale. They tasted a day old. I do not recommend it to anyone and will no longer go back. I will be going to Baby Cakes at M Resort when I visit again.,0
Macarons here are ok. Neither delicious nor disgusting. But certainly not worth the price or the trip from California. I've definitely have had better. I wouldn't recommend this place to friends or family though.,0
"I am a fan of Thomas Keller's and after having purchased his Bouchon bakery book I was pumped to try the treats to see how mine compared. We had a horrible time trying to find this place and had I not been so big of a fan I would have just given up (BTW it is located in the building with the clock in a small location right by the strip). The place is super small and has a little patio outside with a few seats. These seats, unfortunately, were overtaken with a few homeless people and some drunk people sleeping the night off. We tried a TLC, TKO and the carrot cake cookies. The only one that stood out was the carrot cake cookie - the rest were unimpressive. I really wanted to love this place but alas I did not.",0
"Nothing like a French bakery, they cut a croissant and put ham in it like a sandwich. Very disappointed for how highly everyone talks about Thomas keller restaurants. It Must get good reviews here because it's vegas and there are so many people and so many options. It might've better than Starbucks but not by much. It's generic baked goods and mediocre coffee for people in a hurry.",0
"I wish I could give Bouchon Bakery a better review, especially after our ecstatic meal at Bouchon the night before, but it sorta sucked. I like the cute little stand hidden away from everything else (just enter the Venetian and keep walking back and back from the casino floor), not a fan of the lack of seating (the food court is just upstairs and down a hallway a bit though). We had vanilla and pistachio macarons and some other small pastry. Macarons were hard on the outside and the filling was cloying- they'd been sitting for too long, perhaps? Big, which is nice, but ugh, CHEWY. Not a word I want with my lighter than air cookies. Two stars because I have hopes and I really did enjoy Bouchon. And the other pastries looked like they could be OK or even good.",0
Horrible cappuccino. And the caramel macaroons were like biting a round piece of rock. I have been to Bouchon bakery in Yountville and loved it. The one inside the Venetian was blah blah and totally blah.,0
"I ate brunch here yesterday morning with my mother. I called ahead to see if they took reservations I was told they did not. So when we arrived we were told about a 30 to 35 minute wait. We asked to be seated in the section nearest the glass doors. When They first called us to seat us about 30 minutes later they offered us a table that is a shared bench with others. We told the hostess we prefer to not have that kind of seating and would rather have a table by the glass doors. I mentioned they had five open tables and perhaps we could have one. Hostess told me that the tables are reserved. I told her that when I called I was told I could not reserve a table. She then told me that they keep those tables open for the owner or the owner's brother in case they come in. Of course I found this to be absurd. I know that highrollers get better service but I still found this to be quite absurd. So we sat down to await a better table. About 10 minutes later another hostess trier to seat us at another table with a shared booth. We told her again that we would like to have a regular table so she had us wait again. About another 15 to 20 minutes went by and another host came to seat us and tried to seat us in a bigger table with a shared bench. Just as he was doing that one of the original hostesses came over and told him that we wanted a table. I gestured to the now four open tables and he said that they're reserved. I thanked him but told him we were going to just leave. He said he didn't want us to leave so he gave us one of the tables that we had asked about. Frankly, we used to love this place. We always came here whenever we are in Las Vegas. The food and service has always been impeccable. This time the servers were nice, but just overworked. The ""sticky bun"" was pretty dry and frankly not very good. The petite d'jeunre American was just OK and the croque madame, which I've had each time I've been here, was not very good. I asked for the egg to be over easy and it came out almost totally well done. Sadly, I don't see any need to come back here again which is disappointing, because we really liked the restaurant.",0
"Have you las vegans lost your mind? How can you even call these macarons?? These are super dry and stale. I haven't had macarons like these since Koreans tried to make macarons in their cafÃ©s. I bought a box of 6 huge macarons, they looked so perfect... Until I bit into one, and it burst into a hundred small crumbs all over my jacket. Yeah.... Macarons are definitely not supposed to do that unless they are a week old.",0
"I was walking on strip few days ago, and I see Bouchon Bistro. I love french pastries, so I go in to get 2 croissants. Total was $7.50. I've paid with my debit card. Today, I see a charge of $13, which means that the Phillipina clerk rewarded herself a tip of $5.50. So, beware when paying, always have cash for small purchases, or you'll give greedy people direct access to your bank account. Five dollars isn't much, but if you overcharge all people who pay by card, then it adds to thousands of dollars. I used to live in Hawaii, and this was a common practice for clerks to supplement their income-fraudulently overcharge people.",0
"Long line, inefficient staff. Maybe my expectations were too high but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping for the calories. We had the bread pudding and carrot cake cookie. Eh.",0
"For a breakfast restaurant located in the beautiful Las Vegas Venetian Hotel, I expected much, much better. Although this particular day didn't seem to be a busy day for the hotel, we found Bouchon extremely busy. Hmm, that would normally indicate a top notch restaurant, eh? Our wait? It was about 45-50 minutes,,, so naturally I was expecting some really top notch food to be coming. In fact, I was really counting on having some gourmet waffles this particular morning! Well, would you believe it, this place actually ran out of waffles!!! How do you run out of waffles? Sure, perhaps a restaurant could run out of frozen Lego waffles, but I would expect THIS restaurant to be making their own fresh waffles- which you should NEVER run out of! Unbelievable... it's just flour, eggs, sugar, milk... not much required! I got no excuses, just ""we're out"". Okaaaay... well, after I got over the fact they ran out of waffles, I ordered some really basic pouched eggs (which I expected to arrive in front of me tout de suite). Nope, I was once again extremely disappointed!!! Delivery of our basic food order was incredibly slow - making our whole experience at Bouchon a huge time waster during an otherwise beautiful morning. Solution? Well, for the rest of our stay at the Venetian we boycotted Bouchon and had some great fast and delicious breakfast meals at the Food Court... which is the place to go if you don't want the hassles you might be subjected to at Bouchon. Perhaps the test is to ask how long your wait will be at Bouchon and then judge... good luck! :)",0
"Expensive almond/chocolate croissant and no good at all, it is so dry and maybe it is old like couple days. No come here.",0
"The pastries are absolutely divine! We had a bacon egg croissant and best cheese danish on the planet. That being said, the service was terrible. My husband had a 20 min break from his conference so we came here to grab a ""quick"" pastry. After 15 min of waiting for our croissant, my husband went to ask... well it was still in the toaster oven! The workers never apologized they just got another croissant and began toasting it again. Wish the staff was better trained on what to do in these kinds of situations, they were flustered and just gave us the new croissant and brushed us on our way.",0
